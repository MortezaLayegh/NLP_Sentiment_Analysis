The Joker did not kill Bruce Wayne's parents.

Great actors, great props, great music, great special effects.4 The plot line is scary though, espeacially Dr. Crane's mask.5. A few suprises in this one: Wayne Manor burning down and Bruce's suppossed \"mentor\" turning out to be a bad guy.6. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors and the DVD's special features. I guess I'll have to investigate the Dark Knight persona a little more to appriciate it.

All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of bad and good things. They always help and got each other,\"I got you, you got me\"said George, one of the principal characters, and this shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the future. Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they finally lived and work.\n","\n","Sample 33: True Label = 0, Predicted Label = 1, Loss = 0.7072\n","Review Text: The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army.

He has an \"Adam Smith\" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title.\n","\n","Sample 35: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6998\n","Review Text: It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?\n","\n","Sample 36: True Label = 0, Predicted Label = 1, Loss = 0.6998\n","Review Text: Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.\n","\n","Sample 37: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6998\n","Review Text: I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day.\n","\n","Sample 38: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6998\n","Review Text: Works on many levels, but it can be read as a great adventure like Ivanhoe or Treasure Island. Religon mixed with science and technology; where is the line between them? What direction can the corruption of absolute power take, when that power is life after death! What could be done, if one could live a thousand lifetimes? What would you do to live just one more lifetime? The most disappointing thing to me, is that the author, in my opinion has never come close to equaling this book, but then, no one else has either.\n","\n","Sample 39: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6539\n","Review Text: I have made investments before i was recommended to his book.

Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.\n","\n","Sample 42: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6524\n","Review Text: The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.\n","\n","Sample 43: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6524\n","Review Text: The book Of mice and Men was a good book. It keeps you wanting to know more the whole way through. The characters are described very well, but the two main characters are opposite. One, named Lennie, is big tall and stupid, he acts like a five-year-old as they put it in the book. The other one, George, is short and kind of smart compared to Lennie. Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble. Lennie loves soft things, which gets him into a lot of trouble. At this last ranch they think they will finally fulfill their dream and earn enough money to buy a piece of land, Lennie gets into the biggest mess of all.\n","\n","Sample 44: True Label = 1, Predicted Label = 0, Loss = 0.6524\n","Review Text: For several years I have been constantly checking to see if this movie has come out on DVD yet.

My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux.\n","\n","Sample 50: True Label = 0, Predicted Label = 1, Loss = 0.6487\n","Review Text: List price over $500, $300 here.

So the 'free work platform' is actually costing $40-$50 dollars...which is not exactly a bargain.I did eventually get one of these ladders and as long as you don't mind the weight (too much for my
