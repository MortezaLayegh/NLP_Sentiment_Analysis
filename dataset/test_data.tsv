First off this is not at Wal-Mart...the one there is made by The Baby Einstein Co. and is no where as nice, sorry....my one-year old daughter has the Elijah Elephant...she loves it...the ear has a button in it and plays a little song...and there is also a little pocket in the rear that has a little mouse holding a peanut in it.....so cute..my three-year old niece loves it too!!! Good Buy!!!!	1
It was just as I expected, arrived aearly and it was as they said it will be, it's just perfect	1
"An excellent book of ""Cat and Mouse"" (so to speak). I thought this was an excellent book. It was easy reading, interest....A real page turner with a twist."	1
Purchased this for use with my Tracks HD and as others have stated above the sound quality was greatly lowered for me and my left speakers sound is off with this product. Glad I didn't waste more than I did on this.	0
Every reader of the Frozen Republic will find something to disagree with, but if you have an open mind, you will find that Lazare has many good points about America's government not being the be-all, end-all of democracy.The Frozen Republic is a history of Constitutional (and para Constitutional) problems that America has faced and a description of Constitution worship as America's religion. There is very little on comparative government or a blueprint for change. Lazare appears to favor a parliamentary system, but he does not spell this out in any detail, or say very much about voting reform.	1
"This is a live cd(2002), with all of their great hits from all the albums combined. Hard driving rock and roll, like always the great bands come from Canada. Over the years Moxy has not given up, they keep pressing on. This has their all time master piece"" Sail on, Sail away"". Plus 16 other great songs. Very strong singing from Brian and backed up by the best. Do yourself a great justice and get this cd."	1
I could not watch this movie all the way to the end. I found the acting to be sub-par especially the American actor. I was hoping the scenery of old England would hold me through the movie but the scenery wasn't even good. The Sherlock Holmes series that aired on television was better than this DVD. Perhaps I can give my DVD as a gift to a non movie buff.	0
Don't purchase one of these - their are better options at Amazon.The first one (which was shipped very promptly) refused to accept a charge after a day or so. While Amazon sent a replacement as soon as I reported the problem the second one has now stopped accepting a charge after three weeks.The service (as always) from Amazon has been great but needless to say this particular batch of batteries has some inherent problems so look at the alternative brands available at amazon.	0
This is one of the worst one i ever bought. The price is kind of high so i expected it to have some use. There is no vibrating motion beside the rabbit head. Since this product can not be return, I used it once and went righ in the trash.	0
"While the technical specification of JSTL is readable like most hi-tech documents are ""readable"" (i.e. it left me sometimes a bit puzzled), this book is both deep and full of very useful examples. Sometimes, in my opinion it goes too far (programming a message board with JSTL), but this only goes to show how powerful JSTL really is.Overall, I really enjoyed reading it: It made a lot of things clearer and there were a couple of times where I thought: ""Oh, I didn't know that JSTL could do that!""."	1
A very interesting read. The historical content was excellent as it came to life. I could not wait to see what would happen next. Makes you reflect on what values are really important to you and how easily you can be sidetracked and never get back to the place you should be in some instances. On the other hand with some perseverance you can get back on track and be in good standing.	1
Bill Engvall videos are almost always a good bet to be funny. 15 degrees Off Cool does not let you down! His vivid comedy leaves you in stitches throughout the entire show! This video is worth your time and money!	1
If you saw the movie, you may really like the book. Beware. A book is never the same as a movie.... They are better, more detailed, more thought and less hollywood crap ideas of what the public is supposed to want.It was also written by a man from the distant past. So don't beat up the author, that doesn't have our knowledge. GREAT BOOK	1
"No doubt, Clay has an incredible gift. And I'll admit his single ""Invisible"" is a nice change on Top 40 radio. However, he would be better served on Broadway."	0
The price was right. Fast delivery. My sons like. Thanks. Colleen	1
No climax, no definite plot, no villain. This book breaks the definition of a literary classic and goes off on so many tangents that the reader becomes confused as to what the entire book is actually about, not to mention Francie is a one dimensional charachter who shows little growth until the end of the book where she suddenly changes into an entirely different creature. The novel would have been better if it was solely about Katie!	0
This has to be the stupidist movie I have ever seen. The acting is horrible besides Catherine Zeta Jones( she is excellent). But I mean the other girl in there was so dull, 1 word comes to mind when I think about this movie LIFELESS. Cant these producers waste 10 million on a movie that will be eerie or scary, because in my opinion this was just horrible.	0
Although short lived, Cream had a trio with the energy of Jimi Hendrix's Experience. Clapton got with these guys(Ginger Baker, Jack Bruce) and just layed down some of the most influential lines in Rock n Roll history. From the White Room with black curtains to the ever popular and often covered Sunshine Of Your Love, the band had some of those air guitars players playing until they couldn't play no mo'. Although the music varied a lot(anyone for tenis) the album is great! Even if the harder stuff is wanted for your collection from the earlier days, you can not count your collection complete without the first four/five songs from this great compilation. The music I refer to most of the album,I like to call it the hardest blues you hear. C'mon, Clapton left the Yardbirds for it, you should buy them at their best!	1
This video is incredible in 3D. It was a gift for a relative and he absolutely loves it. Viewed on a 3D TV and 3D BluRay player, it was just like going to a movie on the big screen.	1
Having watched all of the batman videos, this one is my favorite. The two disc contains the movie and a hilarious 'tankman' spoof on one disc, special features on the other. The special features weren't that spectacular unless you are really interested in all the behind the scenes shooting, a lot of it is the director talking about his plans/ideas for the movie and how they came to be. The building of the batmobile was fairly interesting and filming of some of the stunts, most of it however was just 'filler' to me. I would get the two disc set just for the tankman spoof, which was a great shout out by SNL.	1
This item broke after a very short time of use. It is not truly waterproof as it stopped working after its first try in the bathtub/shower. The next day it was dead, and water kept leaking from it. So now it's dead.It is very big, way too big to be really comfortable and it is hard to insert. It is not flexible or pliable, so it is not adjustable to people's bodies or preferences! The bullet function actually burns, so it is not pleasant. Also when it is first opened a very very very strong rubber smell comes out, and it definitely does not go away.It's not high quality, it broke very fast.	0
I purchased the Pampers Baby Dry by mistake and I hated them. They leak and they are hard. Pampers Swaddlers are excellent they NEVER leak, they are soft and comfortable for my baby boy. Stick with the Swaddlers or you'll not only be changing the babies diaper more often but you'll be changing the babies clothes and bedding too.	0
This book was given to me years ago when I was pondering a new direction. It was so helpful that a few years later I lent my copy to a friend who loved it so that she bought it for herself and her friends. This recent purchase was for another friend at a crossroads.	1
I had a Jansport pack which I dragged all over the world for 12 years. It finally needed some serious repairs, and I sent it in. Apparently they no longer repaired that model, and sent me a Firewire instead.First, the pack is made for midgets. It is simply not long enough for my back. I'm 6' and don't have unusual proportions, so this is kind of disturbing.Second, the weird laptop pocket in the main compartment is an incredible design flaw. The rigid support at the bottom is about two inches above the bottom of the backpack, so if you load the pack, whatever you put in can't ride against your lower back, and effectively pulls the backpack into a curve so you feel the very straight, rather uncomfortable stays at the bottom of the laptop pocket, and the top of the shoulder straps.It's simply not an acceptable pack for day to day use as it's designed.	0
I love the writing. I love the books. I just sometimes find it a bit strange that the mysteries from Qu√©bec *always* link back to North or South Carolina. But I have to say I'm glad, as Pat Conroy was the only person writing mainstream fiction set in that neck of the woods.The sense of place in these stories is remarkable, with just the right evocative details. The characters are finely-drawn and the plotting is rock-solid. The tension is just perfect. I recently buzzed right through my first two Reichs books with a great deal of pleasure. A very good read indeed.As a side note, I was a bit startled to find *myself* in this book. I've used the name Ivy Lee online for years, and I lived, until quite recently, near Beaufort, SC. That minor character was a bit of fun that made me wonder over and over if I knew Ms Reichs online! Just coincidence, I'm sure.Thanks for a brilliant bit of entertainment!	1
I ordered Constantine and got another DVD instead. I shipped back Constantine at shippers request. Haven't received Constantine yet. Please credit my credit card as it's been to long. I no longer want the DVD.Thanks, Al Pins	0
this is just a jumble of sentences without audio that is needed for htis tonal language. It's a shame that there is no decent method or grammar for Lao. Several other books have similar problems.Teach yourself methods have recently become very flimsy because few of the buyers actually get through them, so an author can sell a lot of substandard books. But for those who want to learn this is rather cruel punishment. It would be useful if the authors tried to learn a language from a book like what they have produced.	0
Yes there were some good effects and wild looking creatures, some decent ideas, a handful of good acting, but where the hell was the story? How many times can you kill yourself and go to hell to see the same thing over and over. It was less irritating when the same thing was done in little nicky. Reeve's acting is normally garbage but he gets put in some good movies like the replacements. This time it was his bad acting paired with an awful movie. You need a good ending.	0
You can get a better quality product for what you are paying, don't get me wrong, it does what it says, but is not the best quality.	0
I ordered this item twice and both times it was broken in a million pieces and it has been discontiued by Anchor Hocking so I never got any of them. so sad as it looked really nice and different so beware if you order	0
Judith McMonigle Flynn needs to have a hip replacement, coincidentally at the same time that her cousin Renie is having shoulder surgery. They are a little apprehensive about their admission to Good Cheer Hospital, because there seems to be a rash of deaths of basically healthy people who have recently had surgery at the hospital. There is a rumor of a takeover of Good Cheer and there are plenty of quirky hospital employees as well as relatives of the deceased which gives Judith a long list of suspects. Her husband is working on a case dealing with homeless people and Judith suspects that there is a connection to the case she's working on. Undaunted by her surgery, Judith travels around the hospital in her wheel chair and, as usual, manages to solve the mystery before the police. This is another enjoyable book in the Bed-and-Breakfast series.	1
I have had at least four of these in the past 3 years. If a gust of wind comes along, the frame bends and you have a bunch of scrap metal. The last one lasted about an hour and a half before one of the legs bent making the product unuseable.	0
I went to turn the volume down and a static discharge from my fingers went right through the volume control knob and literally smoked it. Seems to me you shouldn't have to worry about electrostatic discharge ruining your equipment when turning a knob on the front of the unit! Like maybe using plastic instead of metal knobs?	0
The reception has not been very good. I am disappointed.May be it will help to move it around.I hope so.	0
You get audio signal onlt with no picture when you try to capture home movie from comcaorder tape. In very few case, I captured the video footage, but i just get the audio when you paly it back.When you sent the problem to ADS customer service, you get automatical e-mail response said they will respond to your questions ASAP. but, you never get e-mail unless you call them. the phone line is so busy, you wouldn't be so patient.	0
"Can Keanu spell ""typecast""? After those lousy Matrix sequels couldn't he have smelt the sulphur a mile away and dodged this sad excuse for a film?It's a tired formula - angels and demons are completely monstrous and amoral whereas us poor humans, the only creatures with any capacity for virtue, are stuck in the middle as their pawns. Not very original, not to mention cliche-ridden. Of course his friend (who is stereotypically geeky and likes to study arcane literature) had to die, just as he was trying to give Keanu some vital information! Of course there has to be a slow-motion scene where Keanu kills demon hybrids, a scene stolen straight from Blade. Of course he has to wear a long black coat.And suicides automatically go to hell?! Oh please. Time for filmmakers to stop adopting the dogma of a particular chuch and be more original. And what's with that horrendous depiction of the Angel Gabriel, androgynous, snooty and all but screaming fashion victim!"	0
One fantastic book! Expertly written and researched, Heart of the Sea is a must. I read it in one day. Absorbing. Don't miss it. And give it to the children, too.	1
the program looks fun but the software i recieved was corupt it wont load on any machine.	0
great looking rack. folds up small enough to keep in the trunk.HOWEVER, it only works well for straight top tubes and pretty much eliminates anything except road bikes. top tube adapters do not work well with this rack.Does not work well with over-sized tubed bikes. Large tubes simply do not fit into the slots.	0
Beware...I bought 6 of these with the ridges on the lower part of the mug...since I cannot find replacement mugs for my original (1999) boscoware mugs with ridges on the sides....I was SOO disappointed...these tip over precariously, really bad design..I got rid of all of them, and keep hoping BoscoWare will product the original design...wider at the bottom, more stable, with ridges up the sides..in great colors...I wish I had bought 100 of them!But DON'T get these...you will regret it!	0
There is no close caption to the movie, and it is very boring, due to not understanding what is going on without close caption. Remeber there are 21 million deaf and/or hard of hearing people in U.S.A. that depends on close caption. If ypu cut our close caption off, then the rating falls way down.	0
George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-Four is all catchphrases, Big Brother, Thought Police and Newspeak and it is absolutely rendered down to a zero summation, a monumental ode to nothingness, an ideologically streamlined state of unbelievable being.Chris Roberts(speak)	0
Can you imagine.?? when I tried to find points of Interest near Yosemite. It said No POI found ..Garmin has Mapsource that is far better than Navteq.It has the options to create automatic, point-to-point routes on your PC without need of a GPS so that you can create multiple waypoints, routes before your transfer it to your device.	0
"Even though this became one of the best classics in modern literature, it's not really ""classical"" or dated at all. If you like mystery, you will like it. If you like Sci-Fi, you will like it. If you like psychological novels, you will like it. If you like picturesque novels, you will like it. Anyway, you will difinitely like it!!!"	1
Thought it was a picture book of the Fiords.... That's what happens sometimes when you cannot actually touch a book...	0
So far the air filter has exceeded my expections..The purchaing experience through Amazon was great.. Godd service...Good product	1
Most probably the best Bible I have owned. The NASB is probably the closest English translation to the original Hebrew and Greek, and is very easy to understand.	1

I had heard this was one of the best horror movies of all time, but my experience was that it was one of the most ridiculous and worst movies I had ever seen. I'd steer clear of this lemon. Ugh!	0
Yo i had this sony For about a year now and this thing is horrible it has no user friendly menus and ...it makes a whole lot of noise when it plays a tape it sounds like a vacuum cleaner when it plays tapes!! Im out!!	0
this book is a good read and jumps around a lot, but i enjoyed learning and reading it. thank you.	1
Don't be fooled by the title this book has nothing to do with the Stock Market. It is about how to add merchandise to a store. If your intersted in the stock market stay away from this one.	0
I happen to love Measure of a Man by Clay Aiken! His voice is just so pure and just a pleasure to listen to!All the songs have a meaning to them that anyone listening could find something to fit their lives!I listen to this cd daily, that is why I have to have multible copies!	1
As a Southern woman and the daughter of a schizophrenic, I read this book with particular interest. In places I was amazed to find my experiences described exactly, and the book was always affecting and detailed. However, coming from a situation in which the family came to economic ruin, and lives were destroyed by mental illness, I found the book in some ways too comfortable. A lucky family indeed that is gifted with the money, the isolated farmhouse, and the hired help to manage Maggie's illness the way it is managed! And lucky family whose mother's illness --as we are told at the very beginning of the novel -- is cured. Still, I admired the plainness with which Gibbons told her story, and the fact that she was not tempted -- as the author of _The Daughter of the Queen of Sheba_ was -- into pitching a parent's catastrophic mental illness as an empowering experience.	1

I have been playing video hockey games since my Commodore 64 days and this is one very over-rated game! I thought I had bought the wrong game when I started playing. Even NHL Face-off is better than NHL 2k3. The graphics are only average and the controls are horrible. It feels like the players are skating in sand. The replays are ok but this game doesn't even have a create-a-player option. Sega should stick to football and basketball. Sorry Sega but I miss your Genesis games!	0
I saw this movie over a dozen times & enjoy it everytime. Some viewers confuse this movie as a HORROR movie, & they expect to see blood & massacre on screen. But this is certainly not Polanski style. This one keeps you in suspense until the end of the movie. If you have read the book, you appreciate how Polanski directed the movie true to the essence of the novel. The dream sequence is exactly how IRA LEVIN wrote in his book & Polanski did a good job. There are too many young audiences nowadays only look for 'blood & terror' in movies & don't appreciate such a fine film. They better off just watch the cheap flicks....	1
In the February 2013 mag there are 40 full page adds for some kind of dietary suplaments and 18 other full page ads of a total of 120 pages. There are also a few 1/3 & 1/2 page ads. So all togather about half of the mag is advertisements. The mag is alsofull of graphics and full page pics. There are only a few articles and they are generally not presenting original, thought provoking material.I canceled my subscription after three issues. Maybe this mag is geared more toward body builders that can't read.	0
"I just finished putting together my table and am pleased with the way it looks and functions. It's a strong platform for the KDS-50A2000. As the other reviewer mentioned, it's a little cramped for bigger components; I wish it had more room. Assembly wasn't too bad but required patience.My only complaint is about the Amazon merchant, etronics. I would not deal with them again if I didn't have to. The item arrived in good shape, but they are just way too slow and not very responsive to inquiries. The item sat in their warehouse for days, ""ready to ship"" they told me, but just lingered there. Tracking data was very slow in being provided. If you can buy this table elsewhere, you probably should."	1
1984 was a good book to read. The interesting part of the book was the interworkings of the government with Big Brother and the five minute hate that they include themselves in. Also I liked the characters of Winston and Juila. Both of their stories were amazing and there seceret life together. The bad part of the book is that it got complicated sometimes with the back story of the government. With Goldsteins book on his view of government, it gets to the point where you get bored. Also the characters of O'Brian and Big Brother get annoying. Sometimes I just wanted them to disappear. Overall the book was good but it also had moments of greatness that could hold my attention and keep me riveted. However, parts of the book lacked that spark that kept me coming back for more.	1
I bought my Tivo Series 2 about 16 months ago and also paid $300 for a 3 year term of Tivo service. About 2 months ago, the hardware stopped working and I called Tivo. They told me that the warranty had expired and that I was on my on to buy a new one (no discounted replacement). So I bought a second series 2 at full price, and then recently found out that it is not supported by the NetFlix movies on demand service. Tivo told me that I could upgrade to a Tivo HD but, again, I would have to do this at full price. So the bottom line is that Tivo doesn't provide any discounted upgrade options for customers. The lesson I've learned from this is to abandon Tivo and just get a PC for video on demand and video recording.	0
A great little tool for seeing the normally unseen. Scope easily focuses by tilting the scope rather than fiddling with adjustment knobs. It's so fun to see things really close up!	1
Mackie By Bob Mackie For Women. Eau De Toilette Spray 3.4 OuncesGood product. Good price. Good service. Goodby.	1
This is one of few films I've seen that has such a perfect combination of acting, script, photography...story. It is intelligent in a way very few films are, and treats the viewer with the respect to draw their own conclusions about this complex moral/ethical/cultural dilemma. Like real life, it shows the four-dimensionality of existence. For me as a Scandinavian-American, every emotional note rang true. Wonderful movie.	1
WARNING! the editorial reviews and reader reviews on this page have nothing to do with this book! puglisi's text is a hefty phaidon paperback; the book you buy here is a slim rizzoli hardback. the quadrifolio is actually a set of folded up posters glued into a hard binding. there is a meager introduction, no critical apparatus, no captioning or text describing the paintings, no page numbering, no table of contents, no index. the reproductions themselves are not optimally color balanced, veering sometimes toward green, sometimes toward red. fine if you want it, but don't expect puglisi's magnificent volume.	0
Best SciFi book I've read in some time. I'm hoping that Mr. Reynolds comes up with some sequels.As for those who have problems with the science: maybe you would be happier reading a textbook. I'm sure I'm not qualified to declare that this book is SciFI, Hard SciFI or just a work of fiction, but I enjoyed it and recommend it to anyone willing to not grouse about the science.My only complaint is that it was not available on Kindle.	1
I have had this unit and used it for a couple of years now. the reason that I bought it was its portability and I could use it both in the car or have it with me when I am walking. So, from that aspect, it is very nice. now every positive normally comes with a few negatives. as you may guess, due to the size of this unit, the receiver is probably not the most powerful or accurate receiver, so you need to learn how to cope with these aspects of it. I have had cases where the receiver got confused when I was in the city (San Francisco) with a couple of tall buildings around or when I was driving around on windy roads in Sierra. But other than that it has worked fine for me and I have used it in town and country. I found another navigation SW for it that I think is nicer and performs better than the one that came with it from HP. (...) mine is an MMCX.	1
This isn't at all like the Milton Bradley version, it's VERY VERY cheap brittle plastic. Ours arrived with the top portion of the head warped and unable to stay attached to the body which makes the game useless. But the overall plastic is cheap, there are stress marks all over the plastic that were not caused by us and unlikely caused by shipping.. This is what I would expect at a dollar discount store or flea market where you expect it to either not work, or only work a few times before breaking.	0
I had high hopes for this very worthwhile topic. Reads like Mr. Brokaw is presenting a report on the late news. I expected a more developed presentation.	0
"You talk about bigots! We have adopted 3 black children, 'tho we already have 5 biological. We are so darn happy that we have saved our 3 from the horable, unetical, imoral life that is epicted in this book. If that is how Sister has lived her life, we see absolutely no reason why she would brag about it. Also, while white students are worrying about their student loans, and wondering how in the world they will ever be able to pay them back, little or nothing was said about the African-American students concerns about their pay-back. Oh, yes, I forgot ""We Owe You""(?) Great that Sister Souljah is trying to help her ""brothers"" and ""sisters"", but maybe she should start with teaching them some morals, and maybe cleaning up her act while she is at it. Sister is a talanted writer. We hope that someday she will find something more uplifting to write about."	0
These pampers leaked, one out of five times.Makes changing them much harder.I do not recomend this product to anyone.	0
It was one of the most boring books i have ever read in my life.Why everyone in this society is so narrow-minded.Mildred is the most stupid woman i have ever read for and beatty is one of the biggest liar.So i think Bradbury was probably drunk while he was writing this book.	0
... the first dozen or so pages are crammed chock-a-block with most every anti-Catholic cliche you can think of. I didn't continue to find the rest of them. It's as if the world-changing reign of John Paul the Great had never happened. I know it's only a thriller, but I just didn't buy the set-up, YMMV.	0
I tested this product on my arms for a week. It dried sticky, and this caused me to be very itchy. I ended up stratching up my arms, but after I stopped using this product, my arms started to clear back up. But, still have some scarring. I think I will go back to the original Eucerin that dried clear, and didn't leave any residue.	0
I can truly say that this has made my running more enjoyable, more pain-free, and much more of a learning experience than just a way to suffer through exercise. I've applied it's principles to other areas of my life as well, including biking at the same cadence I'm running (180 bpm for me).	1
Not sure what all the negative responses are about. Are you listening to the same CD that I am? This CD is awesome. There isn't a track that I don't love. If folks wanted to hear remakes of old songs, then they need to buy the American Idol CD. Clay outdid himself with this CD and I look forward to the next one. Now way are you Invisible!	1
We got this game for our 7 year old when xbox still had so few little kids games. This is the worst game we have ever purchased. It is hard to figure out...hard to play...and hard to see what you are doing. It just feels like pushing all kinds of buttons until the game ends.Also...many levels that my daughter would want to play are 'locked' and the game is so hard to win that she will never get to play them.The game has been collecting dust since the 1st week we bought it.	0
The first tile I cut... I knew I had purchased the wrong saw. Maybe to use the rip fence it would work ok, but to cut tile freehand, it was useless. The blade comes up through the table, like a table saw, with the blade spinning through 1 inch of water in the bottom of the tank. The blade picks up the water and sprays it all over the inside of the clear guard over the blade. This makes it impossible to see any lines marked on the tile. It is impossible to make an accurate cut if you can't see your cut lines. Using the saw without the guard is not an option, unless you are working outside, and don't mind getting drenched. Bad design. I'm returning it and spending the extra money to get something good.	0
My daughter loved these dvds so much, we have ordered every set, not to mention it comes with a figure.	1
"I anticipated this CD for so long. I began to fear that I might be let down, and ""Harmonium"" would just be 'just another album.' Oh but it's not, it's definately not.Vanessa blessed us with 11 tracks this time around. The first single ""White Houses"" is simply an amazing track. It's had huge success on radio from Hot Adult Contemporary formats, to Popular Top 40. The video was also very cool, Vanessa showcases her talents in dancing on the video.Other great songs on the album are, well, check the tracklisting. I can't pick out one song that I don't like. Their all unique and original.The other great benefit of this album, is the ""Pleased To Meet You"" documentary as an enhanced feature of the CD. It's a fairly lengthy video filled with Vanessa's thoughts on the record, plenty of live material, and more.5 Stars, definately worth every penny. You won't get tired of this CD."	1
This book is jam packed with gorgeous pictures and ideas. I never realized how many different expressions of Cottage Style there is. It helped me to fine tune the specific cottage style that was right for me. I personally was turned off by anything cutesy but found that cottage style needn't be cutesy at all...if you don't like that look. Nor does it have to look old and antiquey. Most books on decorating I read from the library. This one I had to own. It is a reference that I will use over and over as I 'tweak' my decor year after year.	1
Finally, a novel with an interesting plot and well-developed characters! Allen has created rich characters with depth who are fascinating even when they behave despicably. The psychological complexity of D'arcy and Clair intrigued me - I couldn't wait to see what would happen next. This is a great read!	1
I have yet to find a concealer that I am happy with. I have really dark under eye circles and this does camouflage them somewhat, but not how I had hoped. Instead of covering them, it seems to change their shade. Kind of like as if I were painting and rubbed white paint on a black spot, turning it grey. Get what I mean? It also looks really CAKEY! It could be because I have really dry skin, but not even with moisturizer + primer does it stop looking cakey.I'm returning this for my money back. That's primarily why I bought it here. I'm going to try Eve Pearl's salmon concealer in my shade, as well as Shiseido's concealer. Hopefully I'll find one I like.	0
I certainly do not sound quite as intellectual as other people who have reviewed this novel. All I have to say is that I found this book extremely interesting and thrilling. When my teacher recommended this book to me, I was skeptical, however, Foundation turned out to be one of the best books I ever read and I can't wait to read the other ones. Psychohistory and Hari Seldon rock! Whoever doesn't read this book is missing out on one of the best ever.	1
I have bought sensus memory foam pads for every bed I have had to sleep on in the last few years, and I love them. [...] My first Sensus mattress topper was a 4 inch version from a bedding website and that did cost me over 400 and I still felt that it was worth it, but i would have given up the inch and just gotten the 3 inch version on overstock if I knew it would cost less than half that. The shipping costs on overstock are almost nonexistant as well. Maybe the person who said it wore out after 5 years wouldn't be so upset if he/she only paid 170. That would work out to only $34/year.	1
Scale arrived quickly and setup was very easy.Setup:1. unwrap two parts2. Connect two parts using 6 large screws3. Attach hook on the bottom - DoneI've had the scale about a week and it is reliable and consistant.	1
If you want a movie with a poor script, poor acting, and poor scares this movie is for you. We were hoping for a scary movie, but instead we came across this comedy. Lili Taylor is horrible as Eleanor, a woman driven to save everyone else who deserved to die for deciding to be in this attempt at a production. Liam Neeson, what were you thinking?	0
This is a good ideal but you need to be measures for the right size.I have order the 2xx and it was to little and I order the 3xx and the legs or the bottom part was to big. But I have the Squeem Rubber High Back Waist Cincher Girdle Style 26J in 2xx and it fitted well.	0
This product was great , smells weird but it is a root. I would buy it again, no side effects. Great service and price.	1
"One of the better books that I've read over the past year. Dr. Eby provides a biographical review of the miracles that God has performed in his life, beginning with his birth in the pre-depression era through the 1980's. I heard about this book on the radio and it was described as Dr. Eby's trip to heaven after his clinical death due to an accident. What I found was a wonderful collection of stories about how God worked miracles throughout his entire life, including an amazing story of his brief trip to heaven (he describes it in great detail -- I can't wait!) and a brief trip to hell (enough of a description to scare the salvation right into a non-believer). Dr. Eby is a great story teller and the book is very easy to read and enjoy. A very uplifting and ""feel good"" book. A great book to read to kids too!"	1
Excellent book, especially for those who have some knowledge of Java.I found the way the author explains topics very thrilling. He makes topics that had previously seemed very hard, such as RMI, appear very simple. The book is also illustrative and leisurely. The examples are simple and easy to follow.	1
This is a traditional Catholic study guide book of the Mass of the Angels.The book, though primarily for teachers and suchlike, might very well today do as a text book. Because so much has been lost or is just not taught anymore. It is so well written, and so full of quiet inspiration that a good deal of it could be used for reading aloud in church on suitable occasions.Altogether - quite a find!	1
I bought this because it was recommended by Cook's Illustrated and I've had excellent results from most of their recommendations. Not so with this one. I have major issues with the unit's cleanability. The lid is hinged and is not removable for easy cleaning. The inside of the lid had a scale on it after cooking and I was hesitant to clean it thoroughly because it seemed to be something of a mystery substance and I was afraid that I would scratch it. There is a trough that catches condensation and is also difficult to clean. Likewise with the extremely flimsy gasket. The unit took longer to clean properly than it did to make the rice, and I prefer the old Aroma rice cooker that I bought this to replace.	0
Foundation is not easy to read since most of it is politics in the Foundation Universe. It follows the plot very closely but still keeps the scifi element with things like space travel and intergalactic empires.When I read it I found the religious aspect interesting. The main characters were either scholars, politicians, or interstellar traders, and there were a lot of cloak & dagger type situations. Something I found interesting was that women didn't really play any roles until the last part of the book. It's kinda funny to see this Emerald City (Terminus) in the middle of these warring kingdoms who think they have the upper hand. The use of nuclear power as the ultimate source of energy is a important aspect in the book. If you like lots lots of action, then this book isn't for you.	1
This book was horrible. I've read many books on Titanic, and this has to be the worst. If you want to read a good book, check outA Night to Rememberor getTitanic: An Illustrated HistoryHalf of this book deals with the finding of the ship in '85. I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because it detracts from people's experiences of the titanic.	0
Great shirt in most respects, but way too small. I bought the Adult Small for my 12-year-old son, who is 5 ft even, 115 lbs, and it is so skin-tight he could barely breathe in it. I'm exchanging it for the non-compression version.	0
"THIS AIR BED IS GREAT! I HAD PREVIOUSLY PAID WAY MORE FOR THE ""A--O"" BRAND, BUT THIS ONE IS EVERY BIT AS GOOD AS THE MORE EXPENSIVE ONE. I AM A GAL WITH A ""MATURE"" FIGURE, AND IT (TWIN) ONLY LOST A LITTLE AIR. WITH THE ELECTRIC PUMP, NO WORRIES! JUST A HINT FOR SOME OF YOU WITH BAD KNEES LIKE I HAVE....I PLACED TWO CAMP COTS SIDE BY SIDE AND LAID THE MATTRESS ON TOP. PERFECT FOR THESE TIRED OLD KNESS AND BODY TO GET UP AND OFF OF. KUDOS ON THIS AIR BED!"	1
To call this a collection of Victorian erotica is inaccurate as this implies that all the stories are from that era. I felt rather cheated to realise that a few were obviously twentieth century additions. It might have been more accurate to have titled this a Collection of 18th -20th Century Erotica	0
The Second Season of Sanctuary was incredible. Although I loved the first season, it was more of an introduction to the show than anything else. The second season allowed for more exploration of the characters and the story lines, and did so remarkably well.I never thought I would like a 'Sci Fci' show, but this really isn't. It's not more 'out there' than Lost or Fringe or any of the other shows on basic networks. I would recommend it to everyone.	1
I don't really like her voice though it sounds a little better than the first album. She definitely has a gift for writing piano hooks that stick with you though, without which a 1000 miles wouldn't have become the modern pop/rock classic it is known as.	1
Great heavy duty tape - the dispensers work really well too! Usually the tape falls back on the roll and you need to fish out the ends, but not with these! Great buy	1
This book was way too weird for me and there was never a hook of curiosity. I was assigned to read this for school so that is the only reason i continued to read to the end. It made no sense and was very dull.	0
For all those seeking the ultimate jazz experience this is THE album. Man seeks for meaning by finding the beautiful aesthetic. Coletrane has helped all of us to find that moment and to think the moment was recorded. A Love Supreme stands right at the border between beauty and chaos. While many later avant garde works and even the later works of Coletrane run past that border and become difficult to listen to, A Love Supreme remains in the realm where the listener is allowed to enter the experience of the artist. A Love Supreme is the ultimate jazz album THE CLASSIC!!	1
"For reasons I'll never understand, someone at work gave me this ""movie"" to watch because they said I would like it. WRONG,WRONG,WRONG!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This is is just one long and sick snuff film of the lowest order. Many will like it but it really worries me that this disturbing thing is listed as Entertainment. Igrew up with slasher movies and they were call all kind of things in there time, but this one is truly just sick."	0
Opened the First Season to play and 3 of the discs fell out of the packaging and were scratched. Trying to put the discs back is a real challenge. This is like no other disc packaging that I've ever seen. There is no center snap to put the disc in. You have to try to slide it into 4 plastic half circles(2 of which were broken in delivery) and 2 tabs at the bottom ( one which was broken in delivery). I am returning all seasons as it is not worth having packaging that is useless.	0
Bad cover. Half of the book is ruined because the spine has come unglued...false product description!	0
I hate this gun. It barely shoots fifteen feet at about 50 feet per second. It looks and shoots cool, but it really sucks. I don't recomend it at all	0
"I had this book for three terms of calculus, and it was a headache. For every one person who liked the book, there were fifty who didn't. The authors, in trying to take a ""leaner, more conceptual approach"" to calculus, thoroughly confuse. The chapters on series and sequences are impossible to understand, and no practical problems are included in them. A good textbook supplements the material presented in lecture, and this one certainly did not. To summarize: this book presents calculus in a way that makes it seem far, far more complicated than it really is. And, to top it off, this is an *experimental* textbook that has been around for years. Time to conclude the experiment; it failed!"	0

I purchased this card because the unique capabilities of our network required it. So I can't speak for it's features...But I only paid $25.00 for it. If you shop for this item on on-line auctions, you can get a very good deal.	1
This is a very well written book, I just had trouble understanding it. The begining wasn't too bad, but the more I read the less I enjoyed it.	0

"A small band of children in Florida are trying to scrape up a living in a burnt out dead town. A plaugue (nuclear holocaust, diesease....whatever) killed the adults on the planet which indirectly lead to the death of nearly all the children as well. These 7 children (the oldest being 17) are fighting to make a living when a strange teenager (around 15) appears on the doorstep.He calls himself ""the Anchorman"" and intices the children into a wild journey to find a man named ""President"" (kinda corny dontcha think?). The journey is laced with strange happenings and interesting appearences but has a killer cliffhanger at the end.This book could have been very good, but was far too wordy. It spent far too much time trying to make stories, rather than developing the characters and the plot. On the hole, a rather disappointing start to a series. This review is by a 15 year old avid reader........who is definitely not impressed."	0
Been in the computer industry for many years. Trusted ATI in the past, but this card is the worst thing I have ever had to try and install. I spent over 12 hours trying to install this card and make it work. Currently I have been able to get my system back to where it was prior to attempting this installation. If I could only get it to keep from locking up I would be there. To the writers of the latest code for this card, you shoud be hung from the highest tree. I had had high hopes for the functionality of this card, but with this recent adventure, I will never buy anything from ATI again. In summary, I think a perfect acronym for this card is POS, use your imagination!	0
I am sorry but this CD just does not work. You are better off buying the single mp3 that you want to listen to. Buying the complete CD is a waste.	0
My 3 year old son is OBSESSED with Justice League! Needless to say he HAD to have the watchtower! I too had read the bad reviews and ended up getting it here on Amazon! Yes the three legs don't stay on but after a week of putting them back on a hundred times a day I got out the superglue to secure them on and I have not had a single problem since! Granted you don't want to have to superglue a toy that should work on it's own but if your kid loves JL just buy some glue too!	1
"Keep getting ""Driver Open Fail"" message. No solution availabe, this renders the camera unusable. Save your money."	0
I wasn't expecting what I got with this book. Rather than an all out zombiefest, this turned out to be more of a character study. I was really drawn into the story by the end though. I have a feeling you'll either love this book or hate it though.	1
...because it is a novel. Kingsley started going off the deep end with this one, but as long as you remind yourself that this is just a story he is telling, a story from within him that actually has very little to do with Plato and Parmenides but only one guy's vision of them as characters in a book, it is actually a charming little thing to read. It may be literature and it may be mysticism but philosophy it ain't.	1
Ten gold bananas, two thumbs up and hurrah for Gorilla! What a wonderful book. It was a pleasure to read! If you just want to get comfortable and enjoy a book-this is the one I would suggest.	1
Ok this stuff is terrible. These reviews have to be fake. Like other reviewers have noted, because the wart medicine is mixed into the chapstick like material of this stick, it makes it completely useless. Also its hard to really target just the wart since the stick is so big. You are much better off doing what I did and buying Compound W which is a gel and extremely powerful. I'm having much better success with it. You get what you pay for.	0
Though this work excellently represents the history of a madman, it is missing the necessary evidentiary links which tie in the suspect to the facts. There is nothing which, in a compelling way, brings the suspect even close to the victims and the evidence which is well documented. It was an enjoyable read nontheless.	0
I admit to the fact that the camera work is not ALL that wonderful. But you have to consider how difficult it is to film at a live concert in the dark. At some points, the camera does shake and it becomes hard to see Ziggy. However, the music ROCKS! And it is definitely worth buying! I watch it ALL THE TIME!	1
Mark of fitness MF-180 did not work. It did not pick my heart rate accurately no matter how many times I repositioned it. It was also uncomfortable. I do not recommend this for anyone who needs a reliable heart rate reading.	0
Wow! I cannot say enough about the features that are on this recorder. Every thing that I can ask for in a hand held full size cassett recorder / player. The variable speed is excellent for long lectures or events. On a standard 90 minute tape you can set the recorder at half speed and get 3 hours on it! Good quality play back, voice activated, tape counter, mic / phone jacks, AC/DC, etc. My only concern is the long term quality - made in China verses Japan. For the money impossible to beat this deal. So good that my wife took it away and uses it!	1
Moronic and self indulgent Keanu Reeves vanity project lacks the heart and the wits of the comic book which it steals most of it's ideas form and ruins them with a horrible acting performance by Keanu Reeves, which looks more like he's reading from cue cards than remembering a script. The rest of the actors do better in their roles than he does with Rachel Weisz stealing the show with a deep and strong performance, Gavin Rossdale, doing a very convincing job as an agent of the underworld and Djmon Hounsou giving a bit role more class than he should have. Tilda Swinton does well with a small role that is very underwritten and Shia LaBeouf is well, Shia LaBeouf. Don't expect any more than that.Skip it, you will thank yourself later.	0
From what I understand of these types of hardware, they are created in batch by varying hardware component manufacturers and the resold to vendors (e.g. Simpletech) who combine them into the nice products we buy for distribution.Unfortunately SimpleTech doesn't quite get things right. The driver installation for this product went smoothly on Windows XP. It was a matter of clicking the mouse a few times, a reboot, and plugging in the device into a USB slot.However, what followed afterwards and for succeeding attempts at getting the thing to be recognized by your PC would be what I call my own form of digital gambling. Some days the device works when I plug it in, and some days it doesn't. The odds are usually not in my favor.I would have much preferred a more expensive item that worked all the time.	0
Let's be frank: This is a terrible movie. Racial stereotypes, as one might expect from 1943, abound, and they are demeaning to say the least. The plot is so weak it barely exists. The acting is dreadful. The choreography is lousy. And the heart of the love story is between a 65 year old man and a 25 year old woman. As for Robinson's dancing, well, the Nicholas Brothers are the stars in this regard. And what exactly were Cab Calloway's talents? There is a positive side to the movie: It is Lena Horne. She's a delight, and there are three standard songs in this film. Horne deserved better, and in time her great talents would be recognized. Stormy Weather should be seen in its historical context: Blacks were needed in the war effort, and this was a very rare nod to some of their entertainers by a major studio.	0
Neck harness is a great addition to the gym equipment, however, this specific one is less than comfortable. This harness is the first one I tried so I am not sure how it compares with others on the market.	0
Love this coffee mug warmer. It's wide enough to fit my large based coffee mug and is small enough that it can sit anywhere on my desk without really getting in the way.I'm giving this 4 stars because I wish it had either an automatic shut off after 3 hours or a 3rd option (besides on/off) to turn itself off after an hour. One time I left work and accidentally left it running with a 1/4 cup of coffee on it and by the next morning it had reduced the liquid down to a thick syrup. Coffee reduction sauce anyone??	1

Finally the facts behind the original molestation charges against Michael Jackson come out in a book written by lawyer, Raymond Chandler,who is also the boy's uncle. Written by one who observed it all, Chandler gives a fascinating but fact driven narrative of how the events played out in 1993. The facts: from the sleepovers, the Jesus juice, the almost near possession of the boy by M.J. to the powerful negative media blitz by the Jackson PR team against the family. This sounds all too familiar 12 years later.Great page turner with the facts to back it up.	1
Very much in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs and H. Rider Haggard, Merritt was one of the early avatars of swords & sorcery fantasy novels. He emerged from the pulp magazines of the 50s to write novels which went on to influence a generation after him._Dwellers in the Mirage_ I found to be a very nice combination of all the things that make early fantasy readable. By turns sly and frightening and full of the high-hat adventure that characterizes speculative fiction of this period.Leif Langdon feels as though he never really belonged in the modern world and this feeling is confirmed when he disappears into a separate society hidden by a natural phenomenon. He feels strangely at home with this lost society and discovers the role that he was meant to play in life.Trainspotters may be interested in noting that Merritt went on sometime after this book to co-author a story with Lovecraft. After reading about the Khalk'ru I am certainly curious who was influencing whom.	1
I ordered the edition from 2004, but instead I received the 1984 edition. There is a reason that I ordered the newer edition. It is 25 years old!!!	0
"The first few chapters were original in content and writing style. I was intrigued and reading on in hopes of high ""original"" adventure. Alas, the author quickly ran out of his promising creativeness and the book turned into an amalgam of other sci-fi books. It felt like reading Ringworld meshed in with some others. My interest was lost and I skimmed through the latter two thirds of the book without losing much."	0
"I bought this book two months ago... It's outdated.It might include the information you are looking for, but at a very basic level. I went with the ""Undestanding Exposure"" by Bryan Peterson, and with ""The Digital Photography"". Both have outstanding reviews... and these will do the trick teaching you what you need to know to take great/almost pro photos..."	0
wow this book is very misleading if your a layperson do your research. You will see this textbook everywhere but if you go to were the evidence is this argument completely falls apart are founding fathers printed the first English bible lol but yet these guys say there atheist and agnostic this is funny this book is not documenting a single thing.	0
This rack is a piece of junk. Within 1,000 miles, a part has fallen off, the pin bent, the frame sagged, and has rubbed my $2,000 mountain bike frame down to the aluminum. DO NOT BUY THIS RACK.For the initial journey, I put only three bikes on it for a long trip. The weight of the bikes was well below the max allowed. After my first leg, I pulled over to notice the rack sagged significantly. So much so, I removed all bikes to ensure the rack was not failing. I found the pin bent only after 400 miles! As my trip went on, the rack continued to disintegrate. The rubber frame protector holding the frame to my bike fell off (don't ask me how as it was snuggly fitted to my oversized mountain bike frame). The metal to metal rubbing destroyed my paint and rubbed through my hydraulic brake line. My kids' bikes were also rubbed, dented, and scratched.Buy any other rack but this one. I personally will return to a roof rack for all my bikes.	0
This is not an album to dance to, nor is it one to work-out to. There is no steady beat/musical-rhyme to this album (except for Papua New Guinea, which is the saving grace of this album in my opinion). I can't seem to fit this music to any mood, so unfortunately I have to rate it down.	0
Bought the Tivo 80 hr. Video Recorder to hook up to a security camera. Was advised it should work. Tuner arrived with no instructions and full of previous owner's old recordings. Could not get instructions on TiVo's internet site and have not yet been able to get it to work. We keep getting error msg. that we have to be a TiVo subscriber to use it. Will probably just throw it in the trash where it belonged in the first place.	0
This product does not fit tightly. It tends to fall out of the plugs it is attached to, both at the computer (the male end) and at the cable (female end). Complaint to the provider went unanswered. We will have to buy a replacement.	0
Without the studio trickery, he would be doing community college musicals. The make-over doesn't do it for me either. I wouldn't spend the money and I'd give it away if it were given to me. What new lows will America's talent standards slip to?	0
While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works.	1
Excellent diaper, fits well, stays on, very adjustable size. The only accidents we have had are the inevitable up-the-back, and you have to make sure the leg elasticity are fluffed out when you put them on.	1
"Very, very disappointing. I loved 1632, liked 1633, was luke warm over the Gallileo book, and really disliked this one. Sad to see a great idea/series start go downhill so fast. The ""humor"" in this book is mildly ammusing for the first 10 pages or so then increasing sophmoric and boring for the next 50 pages. I scanned the last 50 pages and then ash canned this turkey. Save your money. I hope ""CAnnon Law"" returns to the quality of the first book, but the blurb on it is not promising. Most readers, like me, don't really care how many angels can dance on the head of a 17th century pin and get really bored with endless minutia about religious arguments. Wake up Eric and give us some fun, rousing tales of survival, war, and innovation in the unique ""world"" you created in 1632."	0
"My daughter needed this book for school and specifically needed an edition with the custom house. We ""looked inside this book"" on line and it shows that it includes the custom house. When the book arrived, it did not include the custom house. Very disappointed as we took the time to check and she needed this for class."	0
This is without question one of the more entertaining books I've ever had the pleasure to read. I had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't fiction. In fact, it has inspired me to read Moby Dick again. I think now I have a much greater appreciation for those who lived and sacrificed their lives on whale ships. I would recommend this book as a Father's Day gift for anyone who has an interest in history, or just enjoys a good adventure. Mr. Philbrick should be congratulated for his efforts!	1
This is a great lil machine. No problems with it at all. It is fun, looks cool and works great. The lil hot dog warmer up top is ok but if you leave you buns in it for a lil while they can get more toasted crispness to them. I prefer to always just wrap mine in wet paper towels and microwave for 10 seconds anyhow.	1

Okay...So the run on sentences and the page long paragraphs get a little old and annoying...However, under all of this is a very intriguing mystery novel...Who actually killed Vinson Gowrie and how did Jake Montgomery end up in his grave? Read and find out! However, one must be patient with Faulkner for he makes you work for every element of the story you get from his books...He's also one of those authors that you just have to keep reading...Re-reading pages isn't the best idea...	1

50,000 years in the future and they are still smoking cigarettes, reading newspapers, the main power source is nuclear energy..and they carry nuclear guns??? A kid in the 2nd grade has more imagination!I almost made it to the end. It had gotten so absurd that it finally just drifted off to a shelf....What I didn't like:1) Lack of imagination (see above).2) Cardboard characters. Nobody to really cheer for..either the character is a pencil necked geek or some babbling fool.3) False religion mumbo jumbo: never would of worked IF most/allthe priests new it was a farce.Avoid unless you need something to stoke the fire with next winter.	0

This film was by far, the most mediocre, melodramatic, hackneyed, and banal piece of work that Bay has ever put on screen.If you have the mentality of a ten-year-old, then yes, you'll find this film entertaining, but for all adults out there, you should best skip this thing.	0
"A huge Beatles fan who stumbled across this at the CD gift shop at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. I actually think this is (was) a great idea for a CD......but this particular production is horrible. They should have tried to keep the songs in the contemporary period they were written. Instead, they take songs which were simple tracks written in the earlier years and try to combine elements from Beatles albums spanning their entire career. The result can best be described as an atrocious mix of taking songs that you may have found on ""Please Please Me"", and remixing them to fit the style of ""Revolver"" or ""Sgt Peppers"". Oh, and it doesn't help that the band they used sucked too. I can think of about a dozen Beatles tribute bands out there that maybe could have done this properly....these guys are BAD. Don't waste your money."	0
Was received promptly, but the quality of the item is rather shoddy, barely lasted a week. Not the sellers fault but still to be noted.	0
This is strictly a tourist rag. Don't waste your time. If your looking for a basic introduction to Voodoo, try Laennec Hurbon's Voodoo: Search for the Spirit; Voodoo & Hoodoo by Jim Haskins; Sallie Anne Glassman's Vodou Visions; Leah Gordon's Book of Vodou or even the Complete Idiots Guide to Voodoo.	0
I bought this bib for my daughter to wear at her ladybug themed 1st birthday. It only lasted a few times after that before it started falling apart.	0
I watched the movie before reading the book. The movie was so bad that I felt compelled to read the book to see if it could redeem itself. The characters as depicted in the movie were very one dimensional and I just didn't care about them or what happened to them. The book tells a totally different story than is depicted in the movie and is SO MUCH BETTER.	0
I consider it an amazing feat of strength that I managed to sit through this entire movie. Within the first 20 minutes you understand what's going on, so then you expect something to be done about it, but NOTHING HAPPENS! You try to convince yourself that the movie must be building up to a great ending sequence but it just isn't there. Without question this is only worth seeing if you want to find out how bad films can actually be.	0
"I always loved Wu and Ghost, so i had to check this out, not knowing what to expect, cause Wallets was just aight. I was def impressed by this album. I saw the single with Missy and I thought Ghost went pop, but after hearin the whole thing, all can agree, this is HOT. Check out ""Metal Lungies"" and ""Run"" for some hot D-Block verses from Jada, Sheek, and SP. ""Holla"" is just Toney rhymin over an old Delfonics song, not sample, the whole song! I hear this song on the Muzak workin at Price Chopper, make me crack up. Hottest track on this album tho, for me at least, ""Be This Way"". Good sample, hot hot beats, some REAL lyrics from Ghost, good message. Like he says on the intro, new label, same Starks......and a HOT album."	1
I'm thinking of cancelling my subscription. Ever since Time Warner Publishing acquired Essence, it seems to be cantering to dark-skinned white women and NOT Black women.	0
I bought the 512mb for my daughter. It's big enough (drive wise) for her favorite songs and small enough (compact wise)she can take it with her instead of a portable cd player when we travel. The sound is pretty good and transfer is easy, though a little slower then the other mp3 players that we have.	1
"The Scarlet Letter is not a dull book if you get into it. It is true that it's language can be hard to read and understand at times, but that does not make it uninteresting. The main story, may not be considered exciting, but the novel is full of literary elements that make it a good book. Several faults are pointed to in this ""perfect"" Puritain town in which the story takes place. The book uses good elements like foreshadowing, foil characters, and a lot symbolism. A main point of the book is Hester's admiting her guilt as compared to her ""lover's"" hiding his guilt. I'm not going to tell you who she had the affair with, but it will be soon figuared out when you see the signs of his scarlet letter. The book may not be as exciting as some, but don't let this keep you from reading it, because it really is good."	1
This must be the worst rendering of a live concert I have ever seen. I saw The Velvet Rope in concert and absolutely loved it! This DVD however is a disgrace to Miss Janets talents. The sound is awful and the editing even worse. All the dance numbers have been slaughtered in the editing room and there is no way to see the great choreography. If you like 120 minutes of Janet close up then this DVD is for you. Otherwise we can only hope somebody makes a re-edit and remix version so the world can finally see a worthwile version of the concert. What a shame, what a waste.	0
"FINNEGAN'S WAKE is an endurance contest that intellectuals get to take, and if they finish it, they can feel superior to those who have not made it. And they can also write learned papers about it that they can publish in their academic journals. As William Goldman said in THE SEASON, ""As long as there is a PhD. candidate alive, James Joyce will never die."" Joyce himself said something to the effect of: ""The professors will be analyzing FINNEGAN'S WAKE forever."" John Lennon said, ""All artist's are egomaniacs, whether they like to admit it or not."" And Joyce is indulging in egomania with FINNEGAN'S WAKE. He spent 17 years on this book because he knew people would spend (waste?) hours, days, years of their lives trying to get to the ""truth"" of FINNEGAN'S WAKE, and feel superior to the great unwashed who don't even know such a work of literature exists. Joyce must be smiling in his grave right now."	0
Thanks for the great price and movie. It was really good. But of course I love the 1st one the best.	1
Don't bother watching this movie. The facts are all wrong. The acting is not all that god. JLH tries her best but falls flat on her face. If you want to learn about Audrey read on of the many books written on her or watch the A&E biography.	0
This is a piece of cold-war propaganda from the 1970s. Please save your money and read more modern accounts of the war without the author's bias.	0
The copy of the poster was a little larger than expected but I was able to make it work with my Japanese inspired room decor. I wish it came in a smaller size 11x20 or 8x10. I would order if it came in smaller prints.	1
Ok, call me ignorant!The only reason I bought this book is because I've heard of it before and I'm trying to read some classics.Who knew it was a play? Not me!A little hard to understand, but after I got past the introduction, I quite enjoyed the play itself. It was very funny.Not sure if you like this kind of thing, but it was just ok for me.	0
The description didn't say that it was the small version! I wanted the bigger version. Doesn't work that great, either.	0
This Amp is fantastic for use as a booster in a system to power certain speakers. I use it for the center channel and for seat shakers. Auto on feature is great and the bridge function allows for use as an amp for the center channel or an unpowered subwoofer.	1
I disliked the book very strongly. If it was in new style english and brought out the meanings in plain words it would have been so much better.It took me reading somethings 4 or 5 times to understand its real meaning, and sometimes after that it still didn't make sense to me. I did find it weird how the story from way back at that time is really close to a lot of stories on the Jerry Springer show.To end my review you would like it if you were into old english literature, but thats just not for me.	0
I have been using this printer for over a year. This is a very loud and inefficient printer. It can't even print doc well. I use top quality paper and this does not help. It is a particularly voracious ink eater as well. Stay away from it, even if they give it to you .. It is huge.	0
I thought it would be fun to bring along some movies set in Hawaii on our family trip. What a disappointment when we missed half the movie bc the item sent was so substandard.	0
This would be a nifty little contraption if it wasn't for the fact that you can't change the top -- my primary impetus for buying it.I have a Handspring Visor and lost my stylus. I didn't want to pay for shipping on a new stylus 3-pack from Handspring, so I went to Best Buy and purchased this instead. Not only can you not change the top so that it fits in the Visor properly, but now the entire headpiece falls out constantly so that the bottom part of the stylus gets stuck in the stylus-holder. Oh, and did I mention that the light function only works part of the time?Not worth your time or effort.	0
These balls are not hard; it's cheap plastic one with lots of air in it, which makes it squish.. if you are looking to massage you feet by applying any amount of pressure, don't get this. I tried it for about 3 minutes and one of them popped and is not useless. time to return it	0
These do not work at all. I have waxed hot and cold wax for years for my own touch ups inbetween salon waxings. This does nothing but pull off some debris if your skin is not spotless. Besides that the price is crazy high considering you will use 4 each time for both upper/ lower on both brows.	0
Tom Brokaw tells the stories of the men & women, the heroes & heroines who came of age during the Great Depression & the Second World War, & who went on to build modern America. This is an absorbing read about our parents & grandparents. Tom Brokaw writes as he speaks, with fluent, descriptive insights. Cogent details set the scenes of the stories of this generation who, three score years ago, readily gave up their futures to either go to war or do the support work for the war effort. Here are the youngsters borne from the ashes of the War To End All Wars; gaining in years even as their nation & those around the world first soared in the post-war hysteria only to plummet later into the Great Depression. Tom Brokaw & his crew have done a superb job!	1
This item is on sale, for a reason. It is not any better than the original one that came with the speaker. Very thin wires. Very dissapointing. I had to go to best buy and spend $35 to get some better wires.	0
"I have mixed feelings for this strange musical toy. If you've read the product copy, you know the deal: twist the ears, flick the ""flicker"", or press up/down/left/right on the unlabeled stomach to create and modify music and sound effects. This is all quite interesting, but I haven't decided yet if it is actually fun (but as I'm a bit older than the target demographic, my opinion on this may not matter).What I like: It's a nice idea, looks cool, and you can plug your iPod/MP3 player into it. The music it creates sounds pretty good.What's disappointing: The moving eyes are noisy and distract from the music. I wish there were more ways to modify the sound. If you have an iPod plugged in, all you can do is add sound effects."	1
"As advised in another review, after ""Kildar"", there ""action"" moves further and further away - with each succeeding book - away from The Valley (Kildar's personal little feudal kingdom).Rather than ""re-invent the wheel"", would simply point readers to my other (1-star) my reviews in this series of trash (and poor writing at that!)JR was so much better when involved in co-authoring books with well renown top level Sci-Fi authors. Upon striking out on his own, he has simply been terrible (and doesn't seem to be drawing too many well renown top level Sci-Fi authors ""knocking his door down"" to do futuer co-authored books together... not since the Kildar series!)"	0
We are reading the unabridged version to the kids and this is an indespensible aid for understanding the descriptive story. The pictures are great and very accurate to the descriptions. Historical notes put the story in context of when it was written (i.e. marvels at an electric engine, extant knowledge of sea life, predictions about underwater scuba gear). The kids can follow along in this while I read and the text is very close. I heartily recommend it as a reading aid.	1
The springs on this hanger are a bit tight. It will accomodate plates of the sizes indicated. I have purchased other holders that are more flexible, and will hold a wider range of sizes. All in all, it does the job.	1
"THIS IS A TYPICAL ""BS"" PRODUCT! IT DOES NOT DO ANYTHING TO CURE THE WARTS, SO I DO NOT KNOW WHAT IT IS FOR. DO NOT BUY IT"	0
This is a small game - easy to pack and take anywhere. It is a lot of fun for kids all ages. My 5 year old recieved it at Christmas but it was played all day by kids younger and older. It gets a laugh every time. The jaw came undone once - but was easy to put back together. It's nice to see the kids enjoy such a simple game among all the techie toys they recieved.	1
While the flexability is nice this uses non standard triple a batteries which is uncommon for most vibrators. Size is actually a little small and no twisting inside, I would recommend this to ladies who like it small or first timers.	0
The playing is merely competent, and the singing sounds like jump rope chanting much of the time. But there are flashes of inspiration. It's unlikely any of these songs will stay with you after the CD is over, nor will you feel much of a draw to put it on again.	0
I'm a big fan of Sohie Kinsella's I consider her one of my favorite writers, and I was so excited when I found this book. I was not let down, It may not be something I read again like I do Kinsella books but few are. I loved it, it is chick lit and as in most cases is sometimes predictable but I don't care, I still fully enjoyed this.	1
High priced, supposedly nice items should be presented nicely... with a little class. This item was wrinkled and disheveled. Looked like a 6 year old packed it. Actual garment quality was poor and in no way die it warrant a price so high!	0
"After using a DVR from the cable company that was ""state of the art,"" I yelled: GIVE ME BACK MY TIVO!"" Tivo is the easiest, most user friendly, wonderful experience anywhere! This is my second unit. My third will be the newer HD model when the price comes down. That will make it 5 stars!"	1
I forgotten how much inappropriate language was in this one. I unfortunately started this with my kids...Won't make that mistake again. Next time I'll check pluggedin even if I watched it before.	0
Electrostatically removing particles works okay, but it requires a fan to move air over the grille. As others have mention consumer reports tested this product at it removed almost nothing from the air. It rated the lowest out of all the air cleaners they tested.So don't waste your money on this product. If you want an electrostatic air cleaner find one with a fan. Before you buy you should really go read the online Consumer Reports report because a lot of air cleaners don't work very well.	0
Foundation is a great book to read. The Foundation trilogy is a great series to read. That being said, there are little elements within the story that date some of the points of reference Asimov ascribes to his characters, but it's actually charming to read the references to 'atomics', etc. Asimov is a master at story-telling, and this series certainly helped to cement his reputation.	1
I have to say I've never had the paper feed problem that everyone else here complains about, and I've had my printer for well over a year. I came here, though, on a google search to try to find out why the color inkjet just never NEVER works. I don't use this often, but I was excited to have a color printer. I think the only decent color picture I made with this printer may have been the first one. Since then I've replaced the inkjets (expensive!), and clean them repeatedly just to get them to print, but they're always stripey, making the color printer (especially for photographs) essentially useless, making me wish I'd sprung a few extra bucks for a printer that might have worked better.As for b&w; printing, scanning, and copying, I've had no problems.	0
"These were so tiny I could just get them over four fingers. Box says ""one size fits most"". Most what? teenage girls? (I'm not a large man, I'm a petite adult woman, fit wasn't even close.)It's really appalling that amazon doesn't a MODICUM of info for items like this (like what's the diameter, the fact that there's NO stretch factor built into these at all.I've learntt my lesson. go to web sites that provide some info for purchases of this kind."	0
I ordered this after my milk supply had dropped. My daughter was 7 months old at the time. It tastes terrible, but I did see an increase in my pumping sessions by at least 2oz each time. I am currently not using it, but will take it again if I need to.	1
Love this rice cooker! If you cook rice often this is a great rice cooker to have. Rice comes out perfect! It also plays a nice little tune when its done. Have not used all the different functions yet but do not have any complaints. I love this rice cooker!	1
There's something in the water in Boston and this year The Red Chord have proved it by following up last year's Boston hardcore/metal masterpieces (Converge's Jane Doe and American Nightmare's Background Music) with a tech metal album that is both accessible and fun yet still innovative. Combining the best aspects of death metal, grind, and hardcore, The Red Chord deliver a disemboweling nine song, thirty minute time signature juggling expose. Incomprehensibly fast and original drumming, technical riffing, and some of the best Godzilla impressions in years are all present. The Red Chord have raised the bar for technical metal on their first release, an astounding feat to say the least. Metalheads, expect to hear much more from this little known band in the future.	1
The author helped launch the first credit card in the 1950's. He describes in detail the many bad things that have happened from Americans becoming too reliant on plastic, living beyond their means. Should be required reading for all high school students!!!!	1
"I am sorry, but I just can't agree with the reviewers who praise this piece of work. It was so boring that I had it running while I did other things around the house (that was after I actually watched the first 80 minutes). I guess I just don't relate to guys who are constantly ""bedding"" every girl that walks past them. Where is the art? The depth? The complexity? Sorry, it was lost on me. I totally agree with the reviewer who said it was about two sad-looking people. I mean the guys is a heel. What happened to being faithfull. Ok, I know its Prague and 1968 and the whole Russian-thing, but come on - the historical backdrop was handled way too superficially. Where is the depth? Lewis is a fine actor, but the material is not the most exciting or throught-provoking. There, I've shot my wad and now I am gonna list the movie for sale for someone who can appreciate it more than me. Bye."	0
Thia is the saddest story I have ever read! Poor girl---she doesn't have a chance with finding a happy life! The cards are all stacked against her from the git-go!	0
Lamebrain horror film that not only rips off a much better film out there (The prophecy) but also lacks the thrills that movie had in spades. Keanu Reeves is still his same self here, which means that he gives another boring acting turn. His fellow co-stars do far more in their parts with Rachel Weisz being the stand out, giving a great performance that has resonance and guts. Djimon Hounsou is good as well but he's barley in the film and Peter Stormare give a great cameo that really should have been a bigger role. Weisz, Hounsou and Stormare give far more acting weight to this lame brain horror movie than it deserved and for that, they are worthy of the praise (Especially Weisz, who does lift this movie above the mediocre garbage it's really is.) but regardless of their worthy acting turns, the movie is plague by a script that really does not make any sense and a director who does not know how to direct a movie.	0
This was a cool fast paced indie zombie movie. Would defiantly recommend friends and family to see this film. Would like to see what this company could come up with if given the opportunity to do a second or third zombie film. Oh and the disclaimer at the end of the film about no zombies being hurt during the filming of the movie was pretty neat too.	1
Might recommend if purchaser/reader were a history buff. Found difficult to follow and keep up with. Not a book I would recommend for easy reading.	0
These diapers are great for daytime but did leak when used overnight. I don't know if the 12 hours protection they claim on the box is all that true so I did also order huggies overnight diapers as well!	1
Hi again, its me(...), the 12 year old toy expert. So, this toy is amazing it will ask you if its an animal, vegetable, mineral, or other. Pick what it is and it will ask you questions about it (i.e)Is it flat? or is it fun? or does it bring joy to people? Answer the questions and it will get it right almost every time. I once thought of a telephone pole and it got it.*************** My top 100 ranking: 13****************	1
Maggie Shayne can certainly write, but this one is a loser. It was difficult to warm up to the hero and heroine - Edie, a former lingerie model is cold and colorless, she returns to her home town and buys up the property that Wade has always wanted because he ticked her off. This is neither adult nor endearing. He, on the other hand, is your typical alpha male who, in this case 'jerks' off while looking at her layouts in lingerie. Not an attractive trait either. These two people are just not likeable and Edie is so dumb, it's scarey - while she's being stalked, she buys an isolated piece of property. The scene where her sister is being tortured is far too explicit for a category romance and more appropriate to a mainstream thriller. The rest of Edie's family were far more interesting than the main characters. Overall, disappointing and not nice.	0
Did I mention GREAT? Clay does such a wonderful job on this album!! I love it!!! All of the songs are so well sung, and the music is GREAT!!! I am so happy, I will be buying more for Christmas Presents for my friend and my kids teachers!! My 8 year old daughter loves Clay and she wants her own cd and poster!!!! Thank you so much Clay!!!!	1
When I am in need of a product I spend a lot of time doing research. Not only are the costs of the product and shipping/handling charges important but also the speed, accuracy and dependability of the company/person involved. I highly recommend this source to be checked out when searching for specific products.	1
Beautiful pictures throughout the book. I do, however, wish there was an index or at least some way of finding certain holes in the book without having to turn every page. Overall, great pictures but poor layout.	0
An excellent tribute to those whom we owe a debt of gratitude and the many more that are not mentioned due to space constrictions.Read this book and then reread it each Veterans' Day as a reminder of what brave people have done in the past and to appreciate the importance of your own continuing role in our country by maintaining standards of personal integrity.An excellent book by an excellent newsman.	1
This was everything that I wanted in a Batman movie. Great acting, action, characters and plot. Best Batman movie yet in my opinion.I saw this movie first in Galway and thought it was really good, but when I saw it a second time in Paris I found it much better than the first time. Emotional score, dramatic acting and dark to the core. Brilliant.	1
I bought this release based on the merits of the two singles which made the airwaves. When I first heard them I was psyched that here was a band with a great new sound that was powerful, raw, and original in a world of mediocrity.Then the CD came. Boo.Aside from the two singles the rest of the album delivers the same old same old... yelling and screaming about injustices in the world and overcrowded prisons and displaced youth, blah, blah blah. I couldn't tell where one song ended and the next began. Look, if these guys ever did spend time in an overcrowded prison or got hit with rubber bullets, then I'll raise the rating.. or maybe if they reveal that half their record sales from their record deal go to amnesty intl. then OK they get a four out of five. But c'mon.... Rage Against the Machine did this already. We don't need anymore preaching guys, let alone screaming nonsense about the government.	0
I've been a fan of Freebo's since the days he backed up Bonnie Raitt on fretless bass and blues tuba. I recently had the opportunity to see him playing with Maria Muldaur. I met him after the show and bought his CD based on hearing him perform one tune from it. This CD is a killer! I don't know how he's managed to hide his songwriting and singing abilities all these years but I'm sure glad he has finally come to the front and given us a much fuller picture of his talents. The span of musical genres on this album is breathtaking and his backup players are the best in the business. Everything from reggae to full-out rock. I hope he has more of this to share with us in a follow on album. This was worth the wait to hear him leading the way! Try it. You'll like it!	1
"Hot Space is not only Queen's worst album (I'm leaving out their contribution to Flash Gordon) but may be one of the worst of all time. From the first notes of Staying Power, one wants to ring up Brian May and ask him, ""Dear god WHAT were you thinking? Did someone put a gun to your head and make you record this awful formulated music?"" Queen is one of my all-time favorite rock bands, but to hear them playing dance music like performing monkeys is torture to me. The first five songs are truly awful (horns on a Queen song??). This is the new funky Queen. Freddie Mercury is ""Calling All Girls""? Please! The second half has some nice rock and roll tunes, as if they woke up from their haze. ""Under Pressure"" with David Bowie is one of a kind. ""Life Is Real (Song for Lennon)"" is surprisingly touching. But even these don't make up for an attempt by Queen to apparently ride the success of ""Another One Bites the Dust"" by turning up the funk levels to 11. Be afaid, be very afraid."	0
This book is an excellent choice if you want three things: a great heroine (in the form of Ayla), an epic adventure (this is the beginning of a long series), and lots of fascinating insight into the ways of prehistoric man and the Neanderthals. I had never read a book based in prehistory and I was pleasantly surprised. The author's careful description of the tribe's skills held my attention, and I truly enjoyed watching the human girl, Ayla, become a woman among a Neanderthal tribe. I recommend this to high school students and older.	1
Great idea--strange reactions to art--is tossed aside and scene after scene is set up yet goes nowhere. (Why does she return home? Why does she have to be a cop? She never shows up at the station!) Poorly edited with transitions so bad, title cards were added so you know where you are -- Rome, etc. Interesting conclusion, yet really, it's a mess so skip it.	0
"""Definitely Maybe"" is simply definitely (no maybe) a great album! The songs are good, and only the beginning to what will become the Oasis sound. Songs ranging from the loud and proud, ""Supersonic"" to the quaint ditty ""Digsby's Dinner"", to the infectious (and my personal favorite) ""Columbia"". This is really a very good album, not even considering the fact that it's a debut. It is not anything like the critics say : a carbon copy of pre-Brit rockers The Beatles, Rolling Stones, or David Bowie. Comparisons could be made that they're all British and play guitars... I mean really... it's not like they just rehash the same stuff! This album is well done musically and delivers the unmistakable vocals of that Brit Brat Liam Gallagher. Simply a great album to have if you want to hear some snappy music that isn't always about angst, but isn't candy either...."	1
Childhood and Society guides its readers far deep into children's mind and its pychological intricacies. Using study of cases carefully chosen and great psychoanalytical knowlege, Erikson, with his long experience, enlight us, making easy to undertand some of the most complicated concepts in Freud's theory.It's sure a worth reading work.	1
I have attended Kremata Baltica's concert in Hong Kong performing exactly the same programme. I was already impressed by the performance of the enesemble for Baltica young musicians and under the direction of Gidon Kremer that night. Now the CD is still impressive. It is not easy to get impressed by contemporary music for me as an ordinary classical music lover, but Piazzolla's music is not pretending to be profound and difficult. It's new music technique does not prevent his expression and comminucation of emotions via his music to the audiences. The combination of Vivaldi's The Four Seasons & Piazzolla's The Four Seasons in Buenos Aires is a fantastic mix as well.	1
This is a gripping tale about two men.One is smart while the other is slow.The retarded one is named Lennie and the other is named Geroge.Lennie has the IQ of a 8 year old.George has to look out after Lennie and can't seem to leave him alone for a few seconds.Lennie infacuation with soft things,get's him in trouble.One time already George has to get them out of a predicament because of this.This is a really a good book and I would reccomend it to any Teen,becuase I have read this book in school,and I am in the eight grade.YOu have to be mature to read this or you won't fully understand it!	1
I bought this as a gift for my husband and the more he uses it, the more he is thrilled with it. Only downside is the weight.	1
"With so many allusions in literature and culture to the infamous ""A"" worn by Hester Prynne, I was very excited about reading Hawthorne's ""masterpiece."" Needless to say, I was extremely disappointed. I did find the symbolism that dealt with Pearl's fascination with her mother's ""A"" interesting, but the rest of the book I did not. Other than to be more literaraly savvy, I would not recomend the book."	0
"The bra is too ""molded"" for my taste. The cups are very thick and feel to the breast the way a helmet feels to a head. It does have a good basic design but I will be returning it because of the uncomfortable density of the cups."	0
Purchased this video for my husband for Christmas. He loved it , But he likes anything with military or World War 2 Air Planes. Hope to get lots of use out of this video.	1
"He gives a TERRIFIC performance as faded movie director James Whale (directed ""Frankenstein,"" ""Bride of Frankenstein"" and the 1936 ""Showboat"", among others) - droll, witty, effeminate, intelligent. Instead of being turned off by his penchant for young boys, you felt sorry for him. Sir Ian was more worthy of the Best Actor Oscar than Benigni. Also excellent work by Lynne Redgrave and even Brendan Fraser. I would recommend this video to anyone!"	1
"My children (ages 5-10) love this book. I have also read from this book to hospitalized teenagers; when I read Oedipus I finished the story and heard a chorus of ""read it again!""I noticed that some of the reviews posted here say that this book is unsuitable for children, but I wonder if the reviewers actually tried reading the book to them."	1
John Steinbeck is a an artist who painted with prose. Grapes of Wrath was my favorite book for decades. I have read and reread it over the years, but I had forgotten about Of Mice and Men which I had read years ago in college. While browsing for some reading material in my Kindle, I ran across the title. I ordered it and was rewarded with a wonderful tale of hardship, compassion, and tragedy set in one of the most trying periods of our countries history. It was more novella than a book. Easily read in a few hours. It describes the strugles of two drifters seeking a piece of the American dream. One man, the leader, is bright and resourceful, the other is mentally challenged, but loved and cared for by his partner. The conclusion is classically Kane and Able.	1
i felt i had to put my two cents in. I read this book several years ago and still remember the magical way the story unfolded. Do Not Miss Out. You will long remember a place and people who existed in Gabe's wonderful imagination. The book is a rare gift of words.	1
"I have not seen nor heard the DVD release of this work but I have the VHS version. What a terrible injustice to the concert! I remember watching the concert on ""In Concert"" way back in the 70's. I even audio taped it on cassett, as it was aired on radio at the same time. No, the stupid echo effects were not on that version, Mick Ronson's guitar work (I miss that guy), was in front and smokin'! Who thought of mixing Ronson's ax just about out of the concert in the first place. To top it all off, Jeff Beck came out near the end of the show and played Jean Jeanie with the band An unbelivable walk on, just blew the roof off the place, you would never know it though since it is left off all video productions.Does anyone know when the REAL VERSION (What was released for the ""In Concert"" show on ABC) production would come out. It must be somewhere."	0
I recently purchased the Power Cotton & Rubber Waist Cincher, and loved it so much I thought I'd give this one a try as well. As far as the smell, it's very faint. Washing it prior to use and putting plenty of dryer sheets in should help the smell diminish pretty quickly. The fit was nice & comfortable. But it's not a solid black like you'd assume. Prepare for a charcoal black/gray color for the exterior. The interior rubber WILL make you sweat ladies, so get ready to have a sticky abdomen at the end of the day. The same thing with the waist cincher, the back begins to bunch up and make wrinkles after a few days.Overall, great product.	1
"This film has to be one of the most feel good, charming, and entertaining movies I have ever seen! After a tough day, a bad experience, whatever unpleasantness the world can dish out, ""Moonstruck"" has the ability to make it all better. The film takes you to a place where it is all forgotten, at least for the time spent enjoying it. Cher, always wonderful, will put a smile on your face from the first moment you see her. ""Moonstruck"" is a movie you will want to own! I watch it at least once a month...it's simply the best!!"	1
"These sheets look as pictured. Following directions to wash prior to using, the flat sheet shrunk to 72"" wide; it is now twin size. Because of the deep pockets in the fitted sheet, it still fits a double bed. They are usable, but barely.Also, since the weight is given in metric, ""heavyweight"" is a misnomer."	0
This product is a ton of fun for the kids, HOWEVER, the balls that are included with the product have a dye on them that has rubbed off onto our carpet....I now have blue circle stains on my family room carpet that I am still trying to remove.	1
This product is delivered almost instantly after placing your order. The no mess packaging is convenient and environmentally friendly. No extra (and pointless) boxes to throw away.	1
I agree with others opinion that if you get lucky and the card installs properly this product is great. I have quite extensive experience with PCs (I have put together over 100 of them) and it took me 6 hours to make this card work. I would give it more stars but..... First of all, when I bought it, it said on a box that FREE VideoStudio 6.0 by Ulead is included. Well it wasn't, instead there was VideoStuio 5.0 which I wasn't able make it work. Secondly, when I tried to contact ATI by email I was getting stupid autoreply totally unrelated to my question why ATI company is cheating their customers. I would call them but they charge you over [X] a minute for support. So the bottom line don't count on any support from ATI.	0
It's like an episode from the Twilight Zone. Three days, lived over sequentially (same day) and this lady has to RUN across the city looking for a way to keep her boyfriend from being killed by the mob. Each time it ends in his death, then the last time she dies and he's the one who 'saves' her. Their next day completely shifts their life for the better & they're out of the perpetual loop.This actress literally RUNS for about half the movie, she's in great shape! Interesting premise. Fun watching the same people in the background in certain scenes where THEIR lives evidentally are very different each time around.I'd recommend it.	1
I gave this book this raiting because it was hard to understand. The words were very hard and I didn't know any of them. The book did have a good plot but they made it to hard to know what it meant. This book did teach us about sea life, which was the ONLY thing in my opinion. I would only reccomend this book for highschoolers.	0
Someone needs to stop Michael Bay. Seriously. This pile of festering rot is the latest in his neverending assault on one of the most popular and well-loved series from the 80s. I honestly don't think I could have hated this movie more if Bay himself had personally kicked me in the crotch while peeing on my face as I watched it. The man is arguably a worse director than Uwe Boll, the only noticeable difference being that Bay's films have budgets to speak of. Avoid like the plague.	0
We purchased the Intex Inflatable twin bed with built in pump. After a few uses it started leaking air. By the middle of the night, it was down to about half full. So, being we are out of the 30 day return time frame, we are just out.If you buy this, good luck.	0
This product was not what I expected so I returned it. Too tight, sizing was misleading. I'll stick with my Spanx.	0
It is the worst risk management book I have ever read. Poor organization and explanation, make the matter difficult to be understood. It is a very disappointing book suggested by GARP. I am a CFA charter, I have good knowledge in most of the subjects, I still think difficult in reading this book because of its poor explanation.	0
These movies are all gems, confirming the great teaming of William Powell and Myrna Loy. Somehow seeing them together never gets old. I also have The Thin Man series on DVD and this is every bit as good. I would have liked to see a few more extras, including commentaries or interviews, but the movies themselves are worth the price. It's a great chance to see lesser known but great films by great stars.	1
For ten years I've had chronic lower back pain from a gnarly snowboarding accident that really affected my surfing, my work, and my active life. I tried pretty much everything -- physical therapy, tons of stretching, chiropractic care -- and nothing really provided nay lasting results.A friend of mine recommended trying yoga as a remedy, but I never took it seriously until I saw the Yoga for Surfers video. I figured I'd buy the tape and give it a try (heck, I tried everything else!). And after two months, I was virtually pain free! I've been doing it for 6 months now and it has been an amazing turnaround. I also picked up Yoga for Surfers II and I'm working my way into that routine.When my dad told me he had back pain, I also got him this dvd, and I know he'll love it.	1
I believe this book to be completely and inutterably crazy. I dislike it because of its content. Honestly i have read a lot more interesting books. Slowly i start to understand it but barely. Choice of words is what i believe to not be good. I think the story would be and entirely different book if Ray Bradbury would have chosen maybe some words and word phrases that children might understand better. I suggest to read this book if you feel like you have time. If your into all that science fiction stuff then you would probably enjoy this book much more than i ever will in two lifetimes. Goodluck, you might need it!	0
holy crap once again this faggot NElly comes out with a horrible album, omg dont get this, paul wall song is whack, the only good song to listen to is Nasty Girl. Nelly is still whack and always will be, listen to true rappers like NWA, Nas, Eminem, Dre, not these bubble gum rappers like Mike Jones, slim thug etc.Seems to me like hip hop is getting worse and worse every year, where the days where people would talk about important things rather then cars and girls.This nelly guy collaborated with NSync WTF!! and Tim Mcgraw also WTF! XTINA, Fat Joe, Lil Flip all horrible people and yet he does it. I dont think he cares about what his fans think, wish he wouldve stuck with something like Country Grammer only thing but this CD is just horrible dont get it!(...)	0
"Wendie Keith and Teague Blackwell had met on the set of the oldtelevision series, THE LOST ROMANCE RANCH, and fell in love.... As the couple drive on Route 66, they must learn to trust in each other and God.This type of romance will appeal to everyone, even readers who don't normally read ""inspirational"" fiction. God and religion are a part of Teague and Wendie's lives, there is no heavy handed preaching. The Blackwells are normal people with common problems, not saints. This is the first Annie Jones book I have read, but it won't be the last."	1
I had to exchange the size but the small is still _really small_. It gives me a nice shape but I should probably be wearing a medium. I am a size 6 with a belly left over from a 25 pound weight loss. It's tedious to put on and I'm exhausted when I finally get that last hook hooked! There has to be an easier way! The back support you get is awesome but sitting in it can get uncomfortable after a while. I recommend wearing it over a light weight tank of some kind. The material used irritated my skin a little bit and it made me sweat a little. Should you buy it? If you are tolerant of the ins and outs, then go for it. It was inexpensive.	1
Super dumb Keanu Reeves horror film lacks the mind bending fun of the matrix movies and has instead a lackluster core that makes this film as hollow as a helium balloon. Keanu gives a very tired and unsparing performance that does drag the movie down most of the time and the script lacks a voice. The second half of the film manages to go against what the first half establishes and the last thirty minutes absolutely makes no sense what so ever because it has a certain revelation that makes no sense what so ever and leave you wondering on what the hell just happen. The rest of the cast is solid with great performances by Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Peter Stormare which the film does not expand on and the script does not give more time to because it only wants to focus its energies on Keanu's bad attitude than the real actors that are in the film.What a shame.	0
...I have ever read.Excellent read for the layperson. Most relevant to our current economic crisis in America. Every politician should be required to read this book. In fact, every classroom teacher should read it, as well. Explains the mess our government has created and why its continued destructive policies are leading our country to assured economic collapse. Policies based entirely on fallacies!!	1
I'm a big fan of off the wall movies. When I read the reviews I thought this would be a great movie. I really didn't pay attention to the negative ones. The description was interesting and the cover art made it look like this girl was over the top, and would be fun to watch her. It was the WORST movie I have ever seen. It was 30 minutes into the movie before I even laughed, and that was the only laugh of the movie. I was hoping it would just end, it was so STUPID! I waisted my money big time! I've never reviewed any of my past purchases, but after watching this I had to warn people. My only recommendation is try to watch it first before you buy it. I guarantee you won't	0
"I expected this to be a fun and quick read. And I just adore the simplicity of the cover...the two heart shaped cherries with their stems making another heart...so cute! Sadly I was just not able to connect with the story. It was just a bit too cheesy for my taste-a bit too unbelievable. I couldn't find much substance here. For an adult book it just seemed a bit juvenile for my taste. The characters did not act the way I would expect intelligent adults (as lawyers -they were supposed to be quite bright) even considering the fact that they were ""infected"" with this ridiculous disease. And the way the legal jargon was tossed into the dialogue. I know that the author was going for crazy and humorous here...but it just fell way short for me...too unrealistic.Note: I recieved a complimentary copy of the book in exchange for an honest review."	0
This is a fantastic first novel. Mary Holt Allen not only captures the attention of her reader, but creates whole characters who carry our attention through their failures and successes. I found myself raging at characters only to fall back in love with them again later. And the story is far reaching and simply lovely. You will be thinking of these people as if they are your friends.	1
There are basically 3 singles out there to ownwhite cover UK single 1 (stellar is not actually acoustic like on the drive single)1. Are you in2. Are you in (oakenfold remix)3.

The remix of are you in is surprisingly awesome to the point you would think thats the way the song is meant to sound if hearing it the first time.Hope that is of help	1
I am sorry to all of you who like this book but I would never wish a single soul to read this. This book has the plot: a girl goes to a farm, falls in love and everything goes wrong. The book just goes on and on. The only reason I read it was because my mother asked me to. This book could have been written in 50 pages but no. It goes on for 300 some odd pages. I would have rather read the dictionary. The only reason I give this book 2 stars is because there was maybe four parts that consisted of 2 pages that were mildly interesting. Take my word for it. This book should be skipped.	0
This is the kind of record that gives jazz a bad name. Russell Gunn, a young trumpeter of note, here offers a set of mostly bebop chestnuts supposedly given a fresh reading. Instead, what we get is esoteric, virtuoso, insider treatments. Yes, there are some stunning moments, yes, the fine assemblage of 20- and 30-something jazzers play their butts off, but it generally comes across as cold and academic: ideosyncratic, listener-unfriendly set-pieces. Where's the warmth, the vitality, the craziness that make jazz such a surprizing and engaging music? Not here on this disc, I'm sorry to say.	0
Fantastic!! My husband and I found this DVD very informative and easy to follow along. We both felt very comfortable watching in our own living room. ;) The instructor puts you at ease. Only thing I would add is more footage of actual birth. (although i still feel nothing more could have been learned by seeing this actual footage) My husband strongly disagrees. He found lack of footage to be quite comforting.	1
Before You Think Another Thought is short, insightful and to the point. It is easy to read and the thought process is well developed.There is no question that your circumstances are a direct result of your thought process. While this is a difficult concept for most folks to grasp, it is true and Doyle does a good job of leading the reader to this conclusion.The book is written in simple terms and has a fairly good set of exercises in the appendix.While the concepts are simple, like any process that requires you to change, they are not necessaily easy. In fact the author cautions against trying to make massive changes in your life. Rather giving the sound advice of taking small steps and making one change at a time.These concepts are not new. But they are presented in a fresh and easy to understand manner and can serve as a great way to reinforce what you may have been taught by others.It is certainly worth reading.	1
I bought this to replace the supposedly same power adapter that I purchased last year. This is NOT the same adapter as pictured for the item (I see that a customer has added two pictures of the true product). I was not concerned with this difference but would have preferred to have a light indicating the power is on. At first, it seemed to power my powerbook G4 fine, but later it started to cycle as charging and not charging, thus making the screen brighten and darken. When I shut the computer and let it charge, it did charge some, but I'm concerned about ruining my battery (which is also a replacement). It simply does not work when you are using the computer..and I'm ALWAYS using my computer! I will have to find an alternative to this product. I thought it was bad enough that the one I got last year quit working, but this is ridiculous.	0
"The book I received was a reprint from the collection of the Univesity of Michigan Library ""Prepared by HP"". It is ""an unreviewed and unedited digital scan which may show library use shuch as stamps, scribbles or margin notes and in addition may have errors which were in the origin or in the digital scans or printing errors including missing, obscured or upside down pages."" My copy included 9 blank pages one with library stamps and one with filing code and pages 18 through 59 were improperly cropped.I think a customer should receive a caviat for a book of this quality if you are going to charge $10.99 for it. A friend of mine was able to purchase a good quality copy of this title on e-Bay for $4.99."	0
Bad Acting, Bad Camera Work, Bad Editing, Bad story line. Sigh. Being a native New Orleanian, I had great hope for the movie. But it is just a waist of time to watch this.	0
I have tried several different brands of diapers for my son, but Pampers are the best. They are thin yet keep him dry for a long time.	1
I didn't like this movie, I LOVED it! I thought it was just as good as the first one and I am really loking forward to the other 5 in the series. Being a fan of the books I did notice some differences but I thought they added to the story and still kept with Lewis's main themes. As some viewers have said this movie is a little more violent but I think its still as magical as the first.	1
This is a lovely book. Not very big, but lovely photos and details with good ideas. The recipient was very pleased with it.	1
Avoid this game. I was gobsmacked to read the positive reviews on this game.There is little direction, you are left to wander about huge levels with chance bringing you across the necessary switch. The 4th level has caused me just to walk away from the game (Confluence). I cannot find a way out of the inital 3 levels. An online Game site I found said it was a bug so I downloaded an 80mb patch and had to replay from begining. Still no luck. Gamesite gave it 2.7 out of 10.The plot sounds great but is awful in reality - the script is like a 50's B movie and rather than guiding into suspicion about the Corporation ejects you into the Ressistance with the speed and elegance as a bad case of diorrea.I came across these reviews while trying to find BestBuys policy on returns of Software. ...	0
If you can combine any coupon listed on the product page (occasionally offered) with subscribe and save, these Amazon diaper deals are excellent. These pampers have done a fine job for our little one and I have no complaints. We have used cloth, but with the recently larger and more frequent poopin going on the last few months, with the addition of more baby food, these diapers make things easier for me. The other benefit, of course, is they soak up more of the liquid stuff as well.	1
I was excited because the collar seemed to work. My dog obviously didn't like it and tried to paw it off but as long as I kept moving he only occasionally pawed it and didn't pull. He usually pulls nearly constantly despite my efforts. However half way through my second walk my 23 pound dog stopped to sniff something. I kept going and the strap that goes around his nose broke. Don't waste your money.	0
It was really easy to put the Squeem on, but once it was on I couldn't wait to get it off!! It wasn't too tight or anything. The problem was that once I stood up straight it bunched up in the hip/mid back area and pinched my skin! It was so painful! No matter how I positioned it, it would bunch up! Really disappointed since it was a waste of $50..	0
I purchased this airbed because I wanted to sleep in the same room as my newborn. Yes, I'm one of those paranoid new moms. This bed goes above and beyond. I wanted to buy the AeroBed first because I'm one of those people who hates to buy cheaper items because they usually break or whatever. I'm pretty much a sucker for the theory that expensive = quality. However, I went with my gut and decided to try this airbed having never heard of the company before. Listen to your gut! It inflates in 3 minutes and deflates in about 3 minutes. If you want it to be more firm & allow the air to settle in better, you should leave it in there for about 7-10min. Not a big deal at all. Go do something in another room while you're inflating it. This thing can also handle a lot of weight. When I'm sleeping on the airbed, my husband comes in the room to tell me he wants to sleep in this bed too because it's so comfy. Great Buy!	1
Good for beginners or for those already on a spiritual path - as always another perspective gives you insights in areas you may have thought you had it all sussed or confirms something you had not quite got your head around yet. Forgiving and generous - a book to come back to.	1
In my childhood (long time ago) Superman was my favorite hero; it was during the comic books time (no movies, no TV)Smallville is like all the comic books together but one million times better. Tom Welling is fantastic doing as Superman; he is the best of the best. I am waiting for the 10th season release.	1
When I first bought this album, I wasn't sure how I felt about it, unlike my immediate love for the first two. But recently I had the pleasure of seeing Musiq in concert and he made me go and reevaluate/rediscover this classic that I had been sitting on since it first came out!! The entire album from beginning to end is very well put together. Out of the 15 tracks, 11 of them are my favorites. Musiq, keep doing what you do best!!	1
Sounds like it should be in a Meg Ryan romantic comedy.Did they intentionally try to erase his personality? Sounds like it was produced in Nashville! This should be a demo for another singer to record.It's just too schmaltzy for me. I think Phil Ramone may be slipping too. Billy is a much better singer than this.After listening to this song I instinctively lit a match. I'm going to go listen to Glass Houses.	0
I HATED THIS MOVIE TO THE FULLEST!!!!! ITS LIKE GROUNDHOG DAY ANOTHER I JUST CANT STAND!!!!,,, I WOULD NEVER RECCOMEND THIS MOVIE AS A MATTER OF FACT I DONT THINK ANY1 IS GOING TO REWATCH THIS MOVIE!!!!	0
I was pleased with the condition of the book and the speed with which I received it. Thanks.	1
This is quite simply one of the very best live albums ever. Plain and simple!	1
An excellent documentary extremely well narrated. The World at War is a compelling watch with all facets of the war covered in the various episodes.	1
I just bought this book 5 days ago. I test in 17 days. SO that gives me at the most if I started studying when I bought this book about 22 days total. I will give you an update on how I did. So far I've read everything in the book, but aside from the practice tests, I don't really care too much because it doesn't actually go through and help you with more difficult problems. I've taken the asvab before, but for the job I want I need to score a little higher to be a linguist in the general section. I'm just studying my VE & Arithmetic since those are the only two that matter. I'll give you a future update.	0
This was brought for my husband to finish his set. He has all of the seasons. It was one of our favorite shows on tv and it will be missed . at least this way we can watch it over and over .	1
The music was slightly different than I expected- more Modern, I guess. I like it though and will listen to it.	1
"Don't buy this video game for the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Vivendi Univeral's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" has too many glitches in it that cause it to freeze. So, therefore, it is imossible to beat this game becuase of the glitches. Skip this title and buy EA's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"" for the Game Boy Advance instead. Besides, ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a boring game for the Game Boy Advance anyway."	0
"CoF perfected the art of music for disconsolate, moody, maladjusted (""Goth"") teens to commit suicide by. We can only hope more of 'em do -- the world's gene pool quite obviously needs a good scrubbing. It's easy to understand the attraction of this dreck -- it's atmospheric, kind of like elevator music in Dm, Dani Filth is an atrociously horrible singer, and their Edward Gorey meets soft porn cover art doubtlessly appeals to the latent Anglophile that lurks 'neath the heart of every American. (And come to think of it, some of Dani's lyrics are as awful as Byron or Shelley's worst prattlings.) CoF is amusing from a socio-cultural perspective, but musically they have all the integrity of Billy Ray Cyrus or Mariah Carey."	0
This first book in my 62 years that has make me laugh & cry. It is an amazing story of a young women who suffering made her stronger to survive & to love unconditionally.	1

This soundtrack is just like playing the video game in a short period of time! If you love this game, you'll love this cd!	1
Firstly, it is incredibly important that you DO NOT use the bundled software for this scanner. The program is confusing and terribly disorganized. I have had several issues with using OmniPage, Readris, and Microsoft Scanning software bundled with Windows. While image quality is good, especially considering the speed of the ADF, the ADF gets jammed during almost every scan with these programs.I strongly recommend that if you have purchased this scanner, use Adobe Acrobat 6 or later. I am using 6.0 Professional and it works like a charm. The file size is extremely manageable (300K for 15 pages) and is quite readable.If you have not purchased this scanner, DON'T. While I don't have any recommendations for other models or brands, I will suggest strongly that you avoid this one. It has been quite an experience, causing me to use Kinko's and similar because I couldn't get this scanner to work. Since using Acrobat, most issues have been mitigated to a tolerable level.	0
this player supports ONLY mp3 and wmaunfortunately, my own-made music format is ogg, and downloaded radio recording is asf format, this player don't support bothand lack of digital recording is a major drawback too, unlike iriver, it has digital in and out, this is a necessary for mesorry, zen, this is not for me	0
This story is epic. Asimov shines in The Foundation. Makes you want to read the whole series. (something Im in the process of doing now. ;)	1
I purchased this product just a few months ago and it's broken already. It was used at a desk with ear phones so it wasn't moved,bounced or anything you would expect a personal player to withstand.It skipped at the slightest bump and went through batteries like crazy.I now have a different CD player and would not recommend this to anyone.	0
Too strong to use on my dog. After trying it on me, I stopped. Too much acid. Not good. Sorry	0
I haven't seen this film in over 20 years, but had fond memories of it. Watching it was like seeing an old friend. The film is a bit dated, and does feel like the filmed stage play it is, but is enjoyable none the less. Julie Waters gives a really memorable performance as Rita. I'm happy I added this nice little film to my nice little film library.	1
I used the Anger Workbook to counsel clients who have anger issues. It is an excellent springboard to discuss anger issues. It is best used with clients who really want to make a change, since there is homework (reading chapters and answering questions). I highly recommend this book!	1

Very difficult product to adjust & strap onto the trunk of a car.The clips used for attaching to the trunk actually scratched the paint on my car. I do not recommend unless you have a lot of patience to install for each bike ride.On the flip side, it is made of very durable material & is weather resistant.	0
This is a masterpiece. Lhasa has a unique and powerful voice - flexible, sexy, and captivating. So subtle in its beauty, it will make you tremble. And the laments will crush your heart. I am not fluent in Spanish, but the music totally gets inside your skin. Beautiful arrangements, beautiful melodies, beautiful voice. It can only make your life better.	1
I really wanted to like this CD - and I even bought it at retail to support Dez - but...it's rather unlistenable. Flat. Unmemorable. Rote. Why not just finally release his amazing MODERNAIRE track from Purple Rain? After hearing that song back in '84, I waited patiently for the Dez solo CD...and waited and waited and waited...this ain't it.	0
This item was like new as advertised an easy to set up with the instructions. We are so thrilled to have gotten a perfectly good dual tuner TiVo at a fraction of the normal cost!	1
I wanted to try this moisturizer since I love Exuviance foundation. I was hoping I'd also fall in love with this skin treatment. I can't criticize anything specific, but I didn't love it. It has a nice texture, and a little goes a long way. It does make my skin feel soft, and the scent isn't too heavy. For a similar price,though, I think I prefer the Olay Pro-X or Regenerist line. Primary reason? I did have a few small break-outs after using Exuviance Restorative Complex for a couple of weeks. Did the Exuviance cause this? I'm not sure. With the easy availability of Olay, I think I'll return to that family of skin care products.	1
"I'm usually not disappointed with a Bruckheimer film, so this was definately a first. The plot was cheesy and slow: All-American, apple-pie, girl next door goes to ""The Big City"" to make it big in the music business...Meets good-looking orphan who helps her overcome stage fright in the most romantic of ways. The movie would have been better if it was, indeed, about the women of Coyote Ugly. The bar owner's story would have resulted in a better movie and a less misleading title. This movie will most likely be a hit with teeny bopper Backstreet Boys fans and junior high school age boys."	0
A soft adult movie. Good to watch once if you are in the mood for that type of movie.Save your money and get something else.	0
I love this movie and I love this franchise. Each movie keeps getting better and better. I'm glad the got rid of Meaghan's Fox.	1
"The authors seem unaware of the fact that theory guides our understanding. There are no ""objective"" facts, yet the authors present all their findings as such with almost no reasoning attached. This is both arrogant and ignorant. The authors display no grasp of theoretical advances in Accounting and I recommend getting a book that has a better exposition of principles as more than practice"	0
A decent story that gets you to turn the pages. The problem is, there aren't enough pages. The story just ends leaving you in the middle of an action sequence. I don't like paying $8 for a book that leaves you forced to buy the next one in a series. I don't mind series (thought I'm not that much into them), but each book in a series should stand alone.	0
There are very few CDs I've purchased that I have loved every song on and listened to over and over again and not tire of hearing. This is definitely one. How could you tire of this man's voice? It is absolutely amazing. Can hardly wait for the next CD to come out and the tours to start!	1
"After ""The Wedding Singer"", Sandler and Barrymore reunite on screen again to deliver this somewhat promising but ultimately average romantic comedy. Remember Guy Pearce`s character in ""Memento""? Well, in ""50 First Dates"" Drew Barrymore plays Lucy, a girl that loses her recent memory each morning, virtually living the same routine endlessly. Adam Sandler`s character falls in love with her and dares to conquer her attention everyday. Cute, and very touching. Anyway, this movie ends up being too repetitive, slow, empty and especially unfunny, mixing drama and comedy yet failing to suceed at both. The directing is nothing special either, and the performances and characters are flat. Fortunately, the flick still presents some entertainment value, so it`s not a complete disaster. But there are much better movies around (Bernardo Bertolucci`s ""The Dreamers"" or Michel Gondry`s ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"", to name a few).Watchable and equally forgettable."	0
The book went very slowly and it didn't get interesting until the last few chapters (out of alot!)I would only recomend it if you like history.	0
It was kind of an interesting film, but I found the music boring and monotonous. Some of you have good points about the technical merits and originality, but I just could not get past the music, so for me it was not enjoyable. If the director and producer both had tin ears, there are millions of cheap, underpaid musicians in the world. Or just leave some of the more obnoxious music out.Germany/Austria has given so much great music to the world: Mahler, Brahms, Schumann, Beethoven, Haydn, Mozart, Handel, Bach, to name a few. It's a shame that this movie from Germany could not do better.The characters were difficult to identify with. Maybe that was intentional. It was difficult for me to understand why Lola cared about her worthless boyfriend.I have never rated a movie this low before, but there are some worse films than this. It would have been a decent movie if they had taken the care not to ruin it.	0
Wow, this is the best CD I've ever bought! The haunting melodies, hooks, riffs, and tempest refrains are incredible. It follows the same formula as the 1995 debut but polishes it, and makes it much catchier. The standout songs are (practically all on the CD): Temptation Waits, I Think I'm Paranoid, When I Grow Up, Special, Push It, The Trick Is to Keep Breathing, Dumb, Sleep Together, Wicked Ways, and You Look So Fine . . . and all the other songs are nearly as great. Really you MUST buy this CD!	1
"Chris LaMach. Chris was my next door neighbor on 13th floor of Neumaier hall at Moorhead State University in 1977. Chris's favorite album was ""Smoke From a Distant Fire"" from the Sandford and Townsend Band. I listened to it so much when I was in college in Chris's room that I learned each one of the ten songs by heart. Try listening to the ending fugue of ""Squire James"" at 3 a.m. sometime when you've been up all night partying - it was enough to make you rethink your misspent youth. The lyrics of this album are sometimes repetitive and simplistic. For example, count the number of times the themes of smoke, fire, burning, etc. appear throughout the album. Also, the dreadful refrain of ""I've got ants in my pants and I just might dance all night"" in the otherwise terrific ""Shake It to the Right"" come to mind. But these are small criticisms. The bass line is dynamic, the vocals powerful and the songs are extremely catchy and long wearing. Just whatever happened to these guys?"	1

"Damn i hate all theese courney rappers,especially Nelly.Suit sold better than Sweat,but there were only 2 videosfor suit,one of them were over and over that video didn't getthat many plays.Why didn't he just do that last year....Dummy.And that new single,Grils that song sucks the beat is lamethe video sucks,and nelly's trying to bring the jewell and platinum thing back to rap.When every boby know's that ""Bling Bling"" is played out,Nelly had nothing but a fake grill and gay parts,anybody who likes Nelly is a square. If you already got sweat and suit you don't need this record. if you just want the song Grills or the hits of both albums than it's for you, but i don't see the point in all this southern rap crap.If you are fed up with rap now a dayz than listen to punk,alternative rock.And if you want good videos,watch fuse,IMF'smtv2,not that mtv pop or BET crap."	0
"First of all, to the reviewer below me who called him ""a true American idol""--no, he's not. Even I know he lost, and I don't even watch that show. Next, his song ""Invisible"" is one of the worst I've ever heard. It shouldn't be ""If I WAS invisible""; it should be ""If I WERE invisible."" Plus, if you were invisible, you'd ""Watch me in my room?"" Mommmmy!"	0
My order came in late, January, to be exact--but I'm still listening to Moya's Christmas CD and loving it. Moya's voice is one of the most incredible I've ever heard. If I were to be asked for a suggestion for future CD's, I'd like to hear more in Gaelic.	1
The only good thing about this movie are the special effects. The story is poor, and even when it has great artists, they become secondary to the story. It is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, and it is basically because of the lack of arguments behind the story.After choosing it, my girlfriend banned me for six months of choosing the movie to see togheter. (And I think I deserved it)	0
I have to say this is a very interesting and informative book for beginners......can't wait to get started. Just bought some of the suggested equipment so I and some friends are well on our way to Paranormal Investigations! Thank you Amazon!!!	1
This isn't even worth it for a basic collector. There isn't a temperature display, but the large problem here is that the temperature control switch offers NO range at all. You could for example set it to highest or lowest settings and get no difference AT All in actual temperature. Not only that but the temperature is too cold for red wine to be properly stored. I hate to be a perfectionist here but hey, isn't that why we buy these things in the first place? I've spoken with other former owners of this hassle of a cooler and heard the same review. The best part was when I called to tell Danby of the problem customer service told me the problem was an isolated problem they've never had before and that the temperature should be able to be adjusted. SO I sent back and received another, then another. None of them ever got warmer (or colder) than 45 degrees and I have sent it back a final time. KEEP SHOPPING AROUND!	0
Just made the wart white, and made the wart smaller, was not impressed. Also this stuff bruses skin so only put on your wart.	0
Purchased these boots on Amazon two weeks ago. They were delivered in about 3 days and the fit was perfect. I have found them to be lightweight and very comfortable. And most important to me, since we get lots of snow, the boots keep my feet warm and dry. These boots delivered!	1
With the exception of Clay Aiken outselling Ruben Studdard's debut album, everything else is an accurate description of MOAM in the Amazon Editorial Review. Ruben's Debut album will not be released until December 9, so, your facts are wrong there, however, an easy mistake since a lot of the 5 star reviewers have said over and over themselves how many albums Clay Aiken has sold over Ruben. What this information has to do with a CD review is beyond me.The remainder of the Editorial Review is an excellent review of MOAM. Definitely gives the consumer real information instead of the excessive spammed 5 star reviews that have been written over and over by the same group of people.	0
It was painful to watch. I was tempted to give it two stars - I love his parents in this movie - until Sam and his girlfriend hopped into the company car after finding out her boss worked for the deceptions. It was just bad.	0
I do NOT recommend this reference book. It has very little synonyms and merely takes up shelf space.	0
"What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive."	1
This has autosensing but you can flip a switch on the back and make it into a manual amplifier as well. Autosensing works best if you use line 2 input as your primary. Smooth response curve and does a great job.	1
I hate this book and wish I was not forced to read it. I fell asleep a good 15-20 times trying to get through this horrible novel. If you have to read it, I feel sorry for you. This is the kind of book that makes you want to go play in traffic. At least that Johnny dude dies. I wish they all would have. DO NOT READ THIS BOOK UNLESS YOU HAVE TO, AND IF YOU HAVE TO, CONSIDER TAKING THE F!	0
This is a great pot.. I used to microwave my frozen vegetables but now I steam them and they come out looking lively bright colors. I also use the other part of the pot for other things also and cleans wonderfully.	1
It's not what you'd expect. Almost all signals around interfere with the video and audio of this camera. I takes too much adjusting every little move the camera makes so it is impossible to view off of a moving toy like a helicopter or RC vehicle as the product states plus RC products emit own signals than can cause video interruption. Not a good product at all. Will be more careful what cameras I buy next.	0
I've never been a huge fan of Voivod, but I was pleasantly surprised by this album. Very raw and over-the-top, with raspy vocals and plenty of energy. I'll definitely be checking out some of their other stuff as well, as this one is really growing on me...	1
i loved it this is the best batman since batman its a movie i watched 5 times in a row and cant wait to buy it if you havent seen the new batman begins its a must see for all	1
Stargate: Continuum is a good watch for anyone who has been a fan of the series. I've bought both this one and Stargate - The Ark of Truth, and enjoyed both. I think The Ark of Truth may have been a little better, but that is a personal judgement.	1
This thing is eeriely accurate. The whole family loves this thing. It's inexpensive & it's hour of fun! It's right most of the time, but when it's wrong, it's fun to see the answers, many of which are really close. It guessed manatee & seal when I was thinking dolphin. Or vollyball when I was thinking football, & fish tank & hot tub when I thought swimming pool.This is well worth the money, very impressive. I will likely pick up a few more for friends & family.	1
"If Amazon would have let me, I would have rated it *no* stars. This Kindle version of the ""Hound of the Baskervilles"" has a huge flaw: every time a character reads aloud from a text, that text is omitted from this edition. Here is an actual quote from my Kindle:""Dr. Mortimer [. . .] read in a high, cracking voice the following curious, old-world narrative:When Dr. Mortimer had finished reading this singular narrative ...""Considering that the omitted passages include the actual legend of the Hound, as well as the account of the death that brought the client to Holmes, this renders the story unreadable. Sadly, it looks like you get what you pay for in this instance..."	0
I first read this book when I was a child. It has always been one of my favorites. I cannot tell you how many times I have read Lorna Doone but I love it more each time.	1
When you put it standing up on its legs, it falls down. A friend of mine has one. He tried repeatedly to get it to stand up, but it just fell down with the slightest touch! After a while we were realy fed up. It was over $39.00!	0
This is a classic in comedies. I have always enjoyed this one and you will to. It is a movie that the whole family can watch and watch again and always get a laugh from it.	1
Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced.	1
If you've never read John Ringo you should. He is a military action/adventure writer. The Choosers of the Slain is one of the books in his series about Ghost, who is ex military, going to college (UGA) on the GI Bill and comes face to face with a jihad plot. The entire series (five books) is action packed, and great reading. I thoroughly enjoy his writing and recommend him to everyone. In fact, I'm reading another of his books (a different series) now.	1
I could go on and on about the various aspects of quality in this film...I will leave that for other reviewer's of this film. I would just like to add it is a beautiful masterpiece, complete in every way. An experience of old cold war Czechoslovakian lovers...there is tension, sadness, love scenes of high taste and quality throughout the film. Even a special few minutes when every woman watching the sequence on screen, would probably be a lesbian for the day. Its not about sex...its all about living a full life and loving someone deeply...buy this film and sit back and enjoy it...bring a handkerchief along for the ending.	1
I bought this thinking it was a band with free jazz reed man, Peter Brotzmann. I was surprised that only two pieces feature him and the rest are Scandinavian polkas. This is the strangest thing. A polka after Brotzmann is enough to jar you for a long time.I returned mine for a refund.	0
Of Mice and MenI didn't like the book at all. The only thing that I actually liked about the book was the character Lennie. I thought that they described his characteristics very well. The author described the way Lennie acted so well, that when u were reading the book it was like u could hear his voice. I didn't like the way the story was written, because that isn't really my type of book. I think the reason I didn't really like the book is because I don't really like reading that much, so that probably had an effect on the way I looked at the book after I was done reading it. I wouldn't really recommend this book to someone.	0
Orphaned Kit Tyler feels trapped in the bleak shores of Connecticut Colony. She hates to work and when she is forced to do so she leaves it unfinished. She hates her uncle, marvels at her cousin Mercy's patience, feels sorry for her aunt and tries to bear her annoying and selfish cousin Judith. The only place where she truly feels free and happy is in the meadows with her friend Nat and The Witch of the Blackbird Pond as the puritans call her. She also tries to keep patience with her husband-to-be. But things turn out different for her in the end. As she looks for peace in her life, she is accused for witchcraft which she can escape with the help of her seafaring friend Nat. But he is not just a friend, he is more than that. And as Kit searches for her answers she gets the results even she couldn't imagine...	1
great product BUT some guy was working and going to call it the iMusic or something to work on Mac & PC but no stupid sony bought it from him now they get the money for HIS credit and its PC only I HATE THAT STUPID SONY SO NOW I NEED TO USE VIRTUAL PC! THANKS A LOT SONY,or should I say PHONY! (yes i know caps means souting)	1
My brother in low loved them. He added them to his Tybo boxing gloves to give extra weight on his arms.	1
I read the first few reviews on here and decided this product was a good buy. I couldn't have been more wrong. After a few days of usage it started to charge for a second, then stop for a second, repeating on end. I've read some more reviews, and it seems this is a common problem. Though it seems other people are satisfied with this product, so my advice would be to stay away from a product with such an evidently high percentage of lemons unless you feel like rolling the dice.	0
This is a beautiful citizen eco drive watch. I am always getting compliments on how nice and shiny it looks. When I first received the watch I had to charge it in the light for about 2-5 minutes for an initial charge and it worked like a charm. The next day I went to work and left it where it would get plenty of sun so the battery could get a full charge. I've had this watch for about a month and so far its been working great ! If you are tired of buying watch batteries get a citizen eco drive. Amazon saved me a tonnnnnnnn of money because I have seen these watches in the department stores selling for $300-500. Amazon does fast shipping and the watch came in a beautiful green case with green velvet on the inside. By the way when you first get the watch make sure to expose it to light for about 2-5 minutes if it isn't working right out of the box. two to five minute charge should last 4-6 hours and a full charge should last 200-250 days.	1
"I am an avid reader. I have read many so called ""classics"". This book is just plain boring! Yawn.... I really tried to get into it. I couldn't finish it. I just kept falling asleep. This book contains some seriously long sentences. Some readers have said to just skip the first chapter or so. I couldn't do that. It just seems wrong. If you are going to read a book you should try and read it all. I am sorry to say ""I have not read the Scarlet Letter."" Sorry Hawthorne.... I really, really tried."	0
"Having not purchased SOAD's first cd, I had labeled them one-hit wonders after I heard the song ""Sugar."" When ""Spiders"" became a hit, I was genuinely surprised. When I first heard ""Chop Suey,"" then learned it was from them, I knew 3 songs were no fluke. I picked up this cd the day it came out, and I must say, I have been greatly impressed by this cd. The way they can incorporate Middle-Eastern styles into hard rock is amazing to me, and the vocal talents of Serj are hardly limited to screaming. I can't wait to hear the next offering from these guys, hopefully they can step it up one more notch."	1
This is the fascinating story of three generations, with a midwife/herbalist grandmother, her single mother daughter, and her bookworm granddaughter. The grandmother, Charlie Kate, is a fascinating, well developed character whom the reader cannot help but admire (she reminded me strongly of the aunts from Alice Hoffman's 'Practical Magic'). Somewhere between a medicine woman and a psychic, she was nevertheless predictable, in that she hung around until her daughter and granddaughter's lifes were fixed and then she died. Terribly predictable, but sparkling with its descriptions of WWII Raleigh and the life of an herbalist/midwife. The book leaves you wishing for a grandmother like Charlie Kate and a suitor like Tom Hawkings III. Good easy read- would make an especially good winter read, curled up in an armchair in front of a fire, covered by a cozy throw, sipping a mug of homemade cocoa.	1
This is one one of the few but great books on my bedside table. Ever since a sentimental favorite book of mine. Eversince taking up and graduating Aeronuatical Engineering in college and a flying course after, this book together with the Bible was always on my flightbag thereafter. Now I even have a copy in my office. It supplied me with inspiration and motivation. It describes the joy in fying, the drama and excitement of flight and the philosophy of the air. A wonderful book and true adventure in a paperback book to aviators and non-aviators of all ages!	1
My sister, Joette Zitwer Wolf Alkire read this to me in 1965 and I still remember the vivid descriptions that the author, Jules Verne, was able to impart to the gentle reader.	1
I bought this coffee pot for my mom for Christmas because she has one just like it from the 80's but it looks awful, this is the 2nd mr coffee 4 cup pot that I bought for her and they both don't heat water hot enough to brew the coffee, the coffee always turns out weak tasting, she tried using a dark roast and still no flavor, never will I buy me coffee again	0
Found the product not to be durable. Both balls split in the first day of use so they seem too fragile for the intended use.	0
I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. This is probably the single hardest job an actress would take on. I belive that people are expecting to see the actual Audrey Hepburn. That is not going to happen. Mrs Hepburn is regarded as the best actress of all time, and to think that Jennifer Love Hewitt can have the same performance is not logical. But Ms Hewitt does a wonderful job of capturing the charm and grace of Hepburn in a way I don't believe that any other young actress could do. Who else could pull off this part? In my opinion, no one else has even close to any resemblence to Hepburn compared to Hewitt. I believe this was a wonderful film and it made me even more interested in some of the classical Hepburn movies that I have not previously seen. Give credit to Hewitt for tackling such a hard film and pulling it off. A job well done.	1
I purchased this set in early december paid over 40.00 -- the next week target had it on sale for 23.00 returned it ... also bought another dvd set(house) and also found that for over 20.00 cheaper at bjs ... the week before christmas amazon put this on sale .... check your prices look around... I overpaid by a total of 40.00 then was charged 3.00 each by amazon for returning it and it took over a week for my credit to come though....	0
This is the story of how, in a future time when books are outlawed, a man goes from burning books to preserving them. It's a cautionary tale, as well as the story of a dynamic human being.I had tried to read this book several times in the past and was never able to get past the first few chapters. The very thought of burning books made me cry, and although I was relatively sure that it picked up from there, I had to put it down several times. The work postulates that books are necessary for three very important reasons: quality of ideas, remembering the past so as not to repeat it, and engendering community between readers. Important function of books, I think.	1
Story is disjointed and so at times difficult to follow. Character development and story line predictable. Reference to other real and fictional characters over- done, but an interesting idea.	0
the charger did work that is the only positive after one day the top broke off charger and the wires are exposed. I guess you get what you pay for..... low grade merchandise	0
I had these bowls on my wedding registry and my sister in law ordered them for me. The first time they came, they were all broken and cracked. We thought it was probably during shipping that it happened so we sent away for a replacement. The second set came, and two were in tact, the other one had a crack down the side. I just let it go and continued to use them...well....4 months later, they were stained, they ALL had cracks in them, down the sides, on the bottom (which means that anytime I put liquid in them they leak). They are practically falling apart after 4 months of use. KitchenAid can do better than this...I was very dissappointed!	0
Hubby brought home these diapers because we were running really low and he couldn't find the swaddlers that we normally use. I really wanted to give the diapers a chance and used them for a while, even after the first few blow-outs. There was leaking every single time. It just didn't seem to absorb anything at all. We're back to using pampers Swaddlers again and I make sure we NEVER run low!!	0
Pretty bad and pretty pointless Keanu Reeves vanity project that takes a well respected horror comic book and literally rips apart the complexity of it and makes it a joke with no story and no redeeming value to it. Of all the actors in the film, only Rachel Weisz manages to strike the right note and make you care about what is going on but other than her, you really don't give a damn about any of the characters and really don't give a damn about Keanu's attempt at drama.Avoid.	0
As soon as I got these diapers I was surprised at how light and thin they were and I was also worried about the absorbent pad not running all the way to the back. The next day my fears were realized and I got poop all over my shorts. It leaked right out the back. These diapers have a cheap look to them and they perform that way too. I still have about 240 of these left so it will be a long month! My wife thought it was pretty funny though.	0
This book was a perfect example of different ways to put together a little piece of an old or too small Tee Shirt with many memories built in one quilt.	1
HAHAHAHA!!! Poor little Clay fans, all whining and crying because Clay didn't get any Grammy nominations! You wanna know why he didn't get any nominations? Well, it's really quite simple...he doesn't deserve any credit for releasing this piece of garbage CD!!! If you really think this album is one of the best of the year, I feel sorry for you because you are missing out on a lot of other music that actually is good.	0
This tape has a great feel to it. Ridden a couple hundred miles on it and they look as great as the day I installed. Super comfortable with or without gloves on. Definitely recommend.	1
Totally hated this book. Now, don't get me wrong, I love LJS and most of her books. Actually, all of her books except this one. Totally borring and predictable.	0
I am a very big fan of Sammy Davis Jr. I had never heard of this movie. I was really impressed. Great acting. A lot of future stars. Highly recommend!!!	1
"I only tried a few test cuts, but upon examination of the tool, it's definitely a good quality cutter and you can't go wrong with these. The only drawback is it's slightly smaller than the typical 9.5"" cutters sold by Channellock or Greenlee so I would imagine you won't get as much leverage using this 1 inch shorter cutter. I also tried the Channellocks though and really can't tell much difference with cutting (my test cuts were on 14-3 romex) between the two brands. However, the smaller size can also be an advantage because it's lighter and smaller so takes up less space in your toolbox."	1
I love this book!! It is an easy read and provides problem-solving approaches and communication techniques that improve the behavior of children, teens, and adults. It further identifies social issues resulting in the breakdowns of our moral intelligence with reminders on how to improve.	1
of course like everyone else chop suey brought me in.... Well, this is a pretty great band. I think that this is a band that just wants peace and not war. But I don't know. I'm probaly too young to get it. But thats probaly the case. This probaly isn't for everyone. But just try it cause you might just like it. I suggest this to heavy metal rock fans! and I suggest that people maybe under 13 get their parents ok first. But this is a great band!	1
This would have been a very short book if all of the racism and sexuality were to be removed. I read it for an Appalachian Literature class, and I felt this book was so racey that I couldn't enjoy reading it. The vulgarity in it is also not necessary, and I feel that it should not be called literature because of this.	0
"My (indoor) cat contracted fleas about a month ago and I used the Zodiac spray on the carpet, upholstery, curtains, and mattresses as I went about treating the apartment. I also used the Zodiac sponge bath (2 treatments/bottle, used both) and one course of the Frontline topical medicine. Today I was brushing my cat and found more fleas. My vet informed me that they have heard nothing but complaints from pet owners who've used the Zodiac products.The label claims that: ""One treatment gives continuous protection against pre-adult fleas for 7 months."" I used the spray generously but here I am 1 month later right back where I started.Just treating my 2-bedroom apartment for fleas is a costly and tedious task. If you're going to go through this, make sure you use the BEST products available. Talk to your vet and explore ALL your options. GOOD LUCK!"	0
I bought this product for my old Dell Dimension XPS-T450 to extend its usefulness. As I was unaware of that the maximum RAM for each slot was 256MB, the computer read as 256MB instead of 512MB. With the seller's outstanding assistance I successfully installed two replaced 256MB memories to get total 512MB, the system is now working fine and steadily. It is worth spending $28 to keep the old computer working as an experimental machine.	1
I kept waiting for something interesting to happen, and it really never did. There was a total lack of character development, and even less plot development. I'm buying the second book to see if the characters die..	0
This was one of my favorite African American films. Bill Robinson was great as usual. Lena Horne was fab-u-lous in her rendition of a broken hearted heroin, singing about her long lost love, while watching the storm at the window. And that storm scene was the icing on the cake. It was fantastic!. Cab Calloway was a treat, the way he stepped out on stage in his wide brim fedora, long watch chain smacking the floor, and that all- time stunning zoot suit; singing Geechy Joe. This film is a must see, and buy, if you are a classic cinema collector.	1
One thing that I have learned over the years is that it is very difficult to capture the same energy, audio and visual effects of a live show on a taped performance. Although I wasn't there, I have a feeling that the flat vocals were largely due to that fact. I have been to several live shows that were mind blowing only to see the same performance on DVD and find that the singers sounded like they were in their bathroom singing. I'm a diehard fan of Queensryche and Dio so they can do no wrong. I'm sure that the experience of the show was epic but the DVD left me wishing I was there.	1
a book that made me put tear stains on the book.About a big stupid man and a quick sharp-witted guy,looking for a good, happy way to live.Both have ambitions for a farm, except it keeps on slipping away from their grasp.It's great, but I gave it 4 stars.I have a feeling that about 1 out of 3rd of the book are details explaining the world around them.Goes veeeeeeerrrrrrrrrrry slow.	1
"Of all the DVDs that I have purchased through Amazon, I have neverhad any difficulty before. Upon receiving this DVD, I put it asidewithout checking it -- it was so nicely packaged. Upon receiving arequest from Amazon to review the purchase, the DVD was unwrapped,but it would not play on my machine, showing an ERROR message.The vendor had sent me (in Norfolk, VA) a Region 2 copy (forEurope, Asia, etc.). Yes, when I went back to the listing on Amazon,it did specify ""Region 2"", but that would have meant nothing to me,even if I had noted it.I give a 1 Star rating because the system will not accept a 0 Star,and I guess the nice packing deserves 1 Star.The vendor takes no responsibility for the goof-up, and it has costme more ($5.00 for Priority Mail) to return the DVD in order to get apartial refund. Am I happy? Heck no!"	0
I am the mom of a 4 and 7 year old and I wish I had played with this before christmas morning. All the the talk in my house about manors has gone out the window when all this toy does is fart and burp. My kids think it is histerical - I think I will find a way to exchange it for something else.	0
*** Infuriatingly Inaccurate! *** Die Hard Narian Fans take heed to my advice and don't even waste your time on this movie. For example Disney thought that it was ok to allow Prince Caspian to KISS Queen Susan ( Attention Disney: That NEVER happened in the book! ). There are a number of other inaccurate happenings in this movie, but I will not waste your time to list them all ... This movie is in my own Top TEN most hated movies of all time. I REFUSE to buy this version. I will not waste my money on it!!!	0
Hawthornes The Scarlet letter is an okay book. It has an okay plot and okay characters, but the book is not one for teens of the 90's. I had to read this book for my English teacher and to tell the truth if it were not graded I would not have read it. The teens of today do not want to read about the ancient customs of puritan society. If it had been about the scandalous affairs of Hester and Rev. Dimmsdale it would still be a best seller. I think this book should be only read voluntarily. If you are thinking of reading it you may need to reconsider.	0
this brush is extremly hard, we cant use it and now the wood is getting black, keeping water insise.... is not good	0
"First of all, no matter how much I washed it, it still smelled HORRIBLE! The ""rabbit ears"" are too long. The part it is supposed to hit isn't that high up. The worst part of all...the head of the shaft doesn't turn. It barely moves, so how am I supposed to feel anything? It is loud, and has a machine sound because of the ""floating beads"" which do absolutely nothing. Look into something else...this Rabbit is a piece of junk. I looked at a lot of reviews to make sure I got the right one, and I was mistaken. I don't know how other people gave this more than 2 stars.The vibrate is descent, though."	0
"In a phrase: as nauseating as the ""artwork"" which besmirches its cover. This book is definitely not worth the price. Donate the money instead to your city's homeless instead! You will learn as much about AI by doing so and will actually contribute something to the world. Of course, the cover makes a great prank at cocktail parties. Place it under someone's drink and it will look like the beverage has been spilled.Winston's book is not only disorganized, but pretentious. He writes about the mind as if he has the authority of a philosopher of mind, when, in fact, he's just a programmer. Winston and his books will go down in history with the works of others, such as Doug Lenat, who made their fame primarily by doing something very easy before anyone else got around to doing it.Real AI is yet to come."	0
"Pampers appears to have two lines of diapers for small babies--Baby Dry, and Swaddlers. My wife and I had to buy Baby Dry in a pinch, and they weren't as good.The primary problem is that the waistband is not strechy AND the tabs have more adhesive than hook-and-loop (a.k.a. Velcro(R)). Swaddlers just have the hook-and-loop. You need to adjust the tabs more precisely the first time because there's less forgiveness, and it's not as easy to reposition the tabs securely because the adhesive loses stickiness.Six thumbs down to Baby Dry. Stop those lines, and just make Swaddlers. That's my advice to Pampers.I give ""2 stars"" because the koala is cute, and the diapers are better than going without !!"	0
My son received this for his birthday and my normally laid back and quite handy husband was never so frustrated in his life putting a toy together. After the 3 or 4 hour labor of putting the thing together the toy would not work properly and my 3 year old son kept crying because he couldn't get the doors or elevators to work. Overall it was a terrible experience and we can't even get the thing back in the box to return it.	0
A historical romance from the 1700's that tells of the true massacre of the French by the Natchez Indians. A good read.	1
I threw it away after 100 pages. Spend the $300+ on Core Content. (I've no financial relationship with them.) Also, I used the Kaplan Master the Boards for Int Med and I'm getting the one for Peds for my ABFM exam.	0
This movie is so tasteless, that it scares me that even one person gave it a good review. I mean come on, a pig nosed commando(yeah right) and a bunch of accomplices who would have trouble successfully making toast are gonna infiltrate the U.S. infrastructure and wreak havoc with the Aids virus? Asnd they are thwarted no less than by a bunch of air crash survivors who have to screw each other before they can muster up the guts to stop this evil plot. Oh man this is bad!	0
My son really wanted this toy, he recieved it as a gift. The tower falls off if you look at it wrong, I will have to epoxy it to the base. It is expensive and does not come with any teen titans. Buy the figures and build your own tower/fort for them.	0
I gave this movie a 5 out of 5 cause the movie itself is awesome. Absolutely just amazing...BUTI had to give the special features a 1 out of 5 casue they suck.Thats just the only way to describ them. There NOTHING of intrest really. Just some intreviews with people about the movie, some other crap about underwater life and stuff. ABSOLUTELY NO SPECIAL FEATURES about spongebob, NO SPECIAL FEATURES for Kids. They would HATE these lame excuses for special features..... nothing interesting or fun at all.Boo to everyone who had imput on this DVD for the spcial features, they really droped the bomb on it !!!!	0
Don't listen to the other reviews. 1) Sam Gopal does not 'pound the drums', he is a highly skilled tabla player from India. 2) This was not a hastily conceived novelty act, but a follow on to the prior Sam Gopal's Dream. What you will find are 11 great tracks of heavy moody psych with an eastern slant. Other memebers included Lemmy later of Hawkwind and Motorhead and Andy Clark later of Clark-Hutchinson (and currently working with Gopal again).	1
While the book gives some interesting insights into Franklin's life, it is really a disjointed diary kept during his early days and during his very late life. It fails to deliver the real picture. I was particularly disappointed that it provided only but a mention of Franklin's early electricity experiments. Most of his middle life was missing. Amazon offers the book free so, you get what you pay for. I would rather read a studied biography.	0
A Lewisian telling of the myth of Cupid and Psyche from the viewpoint of one of Psyche's sisters, drawn as a very sympathetic character. As always, Lewis writes well, with insight into the depths and heights of human psychology, and with subtle allegory and a taste for grand and weighty endings. It's a good book, not ponderous but sometimes deep, easily worth the time.Also as always, I have the feeling that Lewis has introduced some quiet saboteur memes into my brain, and that some day they'll all join together and I'll wake up and find myself a Christian. It hasn't happened yet, though! Perhaps, having been brought up on the Narnia books, I've developed some immunity...	1
"Filter is a little narrow, but it worked fine until I unscrewed it during the third use. Perhaps I overtighted it, but it was a little hard to unscrew from the lens. When it finally came off, the two glass pieces separated. Unfortunately I wasn't able to reassemble the two pieces, so I tossed them in the trash and thought to myself, ""That's what I get for [...]."""	0
The Greatest Generation is pretty good, considering. I mean what can one really expect by way of literature from over paid, telegenic, media stars? I enjoyed the references to Howard Stern. Too bad Brokaw didn't give Stern his own chapter. The book reminded me of Getting To Howard: The Odyssey of an Obsessed Howard Stern Fan. Now that's a great book. Sort of like Tolstoy meets Dr. Seuss.	0
i was hoping to gain some entertainment while reading things that will keep my interest but like most magazines, this was full of ads and the articles either seemed generic or just didnt keep my attention.	0
The quotes are wonderful, but the rest is an atrocity and an offense to the intellect of the reader with all the simplifications and self-pity. Please read some literature instead.	0
Ok, I must say I am a huge fan of Nirvana and Kurt's work, but this film......it was interesting if you're willing to sit and watch nothing. This film was about Kurt's last days and what he did, but it was a terrible thing to watch if your a fan because you get absolutely nothing out of it. Most of the music in the movie was terrible in choice; the only part of this movie that i liked was the very end scene where the ghost climbs out of the body. This movie didn't hold my interest at all; it was wandering, mumbling, eating, avoiding. How could you make a film about Kurt Cobain, the man who made grunge, so terrible? I must say I don't think any fan of Nirvana should watch this.Also the very end of the movie says:In memory ofKurt Cobain1967-1994This movie should not have been in memory of Kurt.	0
I think that this book is a bad book. Not only is it unrealistic, but also a boring book. Orwell has an imaginative mind, I must say, but thuis book talks about 1949, when he published it when there were such things as totalitarism. How could he know it would still be the exact same thing in 1984? This book also has strange events. The author skipped around too many times. At one sentence, he would be in the appartment in Winston's home, and without telling a reason for it, he would be some where else. The book is also boring. There is not enough action and suspense to make the reader willing to read it.	0
"Barely applies any heat to the cup. Fresh-off-the-stove water was luke-warm within 15 minutes. Very poor, and highly disappointing, performance. Would never buy another ""Mr. Coffee"" cup warmer."	0
With hundreds of versions of The Cherry Orchard available, you would think that Amazon would have the sense to name the translator. I think this is the same version used by LA Theater Works in which case the translator would be Michael Frayn.	0
Of course this is a classic of American literature, and, to my mind, with good reason. The story engages and puts one in the time. It requires a modern reader to stretch, but the exercise rewards.	1
Benny Morris rose to the forefront of Israel's 'New Historians' in the 1980's with the publication of 'Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem,' which provided radically new evidence which altered modern perceptions of the region forever. Morris retains his important findings in Righteous Victims and expands on them, covering virtually the entire history of the Israel-Palestine conflict. I found the earlier chapters leading up to the creation of the State of Israel on the earliest Zionist settlers to be particularly interesting; Morris presents a picture which indicates that the current bloodshed is by no means a product of natural necessity. The ethnic cleansing of Palestine and subsequent military occupation is the cause. However, Morris becomes overly ideological in the concluding sections of the book, allowing his harsh realist politics to creep in. Nevertheless, this is arguably the most comprehensive single volume about the history of the conflict.	1
This is just a horrible product. If you want to waste $72 on a product that will ruin your skin, look no further. If you want to breakout horribly even if you don't normally and to have an awful rash on your face for days, this is the product for you. If you want to have to deal with a company that just doesn't care about anything except for making a quick buck, buy from MD Skincare.	0

"I needed a copy of ""Leaves of Grass"" that includes the 1855 prose preface. The formatting of this Kindle book is perfect. I know I could read it on my computer for free on some websites, but I wanted a version for my Kindle. This Kindle edition will not disappoint you! I gladly paid $1 for a more ""portable"" option. I prefer reading on Kindle than the computer screen."	1
I was looking for a source that would contain actual factual information on chemistry. This book is nothing but a long, absurd joke.	0
"Holy god, don't buy this book. It is intensely bad and over-appreciated. 1000 words cannot even begin to do justice to the extent of this book's worthlessness.Clearly, 18th Century vernacular is a hurdle in any book, but I doubt Garrison Keillor could rework this story into something bearable. The story is an exercise in description and banality. There is virtually no inertia or direction to the plot, and characterization is hopelessly shallow.Seriously, don't get this book. I'm warning you. I love great literature, and I hate this book. Ok...""hate"" is a little rough, but I really, really don't like it. Try something more enjoyable; like stapling your hand to your eyelid.Ok, just so I have not wasted all your time, read anything by Wilde or Kafka instead. Read some freaking Mark Twain, for goodness sake. Just lay off the Goldsmith."	0
It takes a long time to learn about over fifty characters and this novel's meandering prose and run-on sentences don't make it any quicker. This is gritty, offbeat stuff for the serious Garcia-Marquez enthusiast. The reward readers must feel at the end is that they've endured a tedious, difficult novel, but not an enjoyable one.	0
"The remixes on this album are great. But the set is a tad disappointing. ""Survivor"" Remix has verse 2 cut. And If you own The Vinyl record edition (Which this review is on), ""Heard a word"" is missing. The ""Jumpin Jumpin"" remix is great. It starts with the So-So Def remix and then bursts out into a slow remix with new vocals. Other than that, This is a great remix album. It also helps cut down on having to buy all of DC's cd and vinyl singles, which a lot of the remixes appear on."	1
I have been searching for a book on 9-11 to hand down to future generations of my family, and I thought that I could not go wrong with a book published by Life. However, after perusing through the book I ended up returning it. If you are interested only in what happened in New York City, this is a great book--but the Pentagon and Pennsylvania incidents barely received a page or two of coverage. Since I live just a few miles from the Pentagon in Alexandria, Virginia and drive by the damaged side each day as I head toward Memorial Bridge to work, that is what I am interested in reading about. I am very disappointed that Life treated the Pentagon as a postscript.	0
In How to Beat the Democrats and Other Subversive Ideas, Horowitz uses ruthless intellect to demolish the foundations upon which the new Left has tried to rebuild itself following the collapse of communism across the world.After reading this book you have to ask how Bill Clinton and Tony Blair can sleep at night.Used as a campaign blueprint, How to Beat the Democrats offers conservatives the tools to take on the Left in electoral combat which have been sadly lacking over the last decade.	1
The events of 9-11 are still unfolding 8 years later. Scientists from BYU and the University of Copenhagen have recently completed a well-researched and comprehensive analysis of nano-thermite found within numerous samples taken on and shortly after 9-11. NIST only recently completed their investigation of Building 7, and concluded that fire, alone, caused this 47-story building to freefall (in the exact same manner as an engineered implosion) at 5:20 pm on 9-11. NIST refuses to analyze samples for explosive materials (even after the recent confirmation of presence at the scene of this horrific crime). This book, like the media, does not include these uncomfortable facts...but these facts must be known by every caring citizen of this Nation. Our future depends upon the public taking the time to educate themselves.	0
Terry Pratchett has really carved his own little niche in the fantasy genre. I am often reminded of Douglas Adams' Hitchiker's Guide to the Galaxy series when I read a Discworld novel. Excellent prose, and the dry, witty, British humor you can't get enough of.Men at Arms is the second Discworld novel featuring the Night Watch (the first was Guards! Guards!)The Watch features the crew from the previous book (Vimes, Carrot, Colon and Nobby) and some new recruits. Someone is murdered in a most mysterious way, and it's up to the Watch to get to the bottom of it.What I love about Pratchett is he doesn't settle to just write a witty satire. It's actually a great mystery/fantasy story with great characters who have excellent believable relationships.Men at Arms even has some scenes that I found emotionally stirring. I loved Guards! Guards! but I personally enjoyed Men at Arms more. This is an excellent and brilliantly imagined story.	1
"this toy is fun if your going to use it for making music and sound effects and stuff like that. I WOULD NOT GIVE THIS TOY TO ANY1 OVER 10. i got it for its iPod speaker capability and it was horrible!!!!!!! iz's eyEs move and make an annoying noise, and its ""funny"" comments occur sooooo often during the song that it is impossible to tell what you're listening to. IZ's basically one of those toy babys in a cool covering. it farts, it burps, it annoys the heck out of you."	0
"I bought a 1 yr subscription to Hot Rod Magazine last year and they just charged it again for this year without my consent or permission. I don't know about you but when I pay for a yr with my credit card its not meant to be an annuity. Maybe they have some hidden fine print that makes this ""legal"" and maybe they don't. Totally unethical behavior in my opinion. Like the mag but I will not be doing business with these people in the future."	0
"The printer arrived in a box hardly big enough to contain it. Thin cardboard, very thin styrofoam and the printer didn't print. I contacted the seller. The seller sent a ""new"" cartridge. Still didn't print. The seller then had me send that printer back and sent another printer.It took a good two months to get the second printer which I have never bothered to open because it is futile.Instead, I used the cartridge they sent in my other HP that is the same model. Normally, one of those 12 A Cartridges lasts me a year of hard use. This one stopped working today!!!! I have not used it for even a month!!! These cartridges cost $86.00! This was the biggest ripoff I have ever experienced!Do not, do not fall into the same trap I did."	0
sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it	0
I love that this book is light and small. My only complaint is that it is hardcover with a dustjacket--something more durable would be more practical for toting along to the campfire.This is really a book of standards, not an all-encompassing book of some of the more modern songs you might have sung as Girl/Boy Scout. Standards include Amazing Grace, America, Home on the Range, Kumbayah, Old MacDonald, Skip to My Lou, Taps, This Old Man. All songs have the music written out for the first verse, and all verses are included.	1
"I ordered a ProTouch keyboard protector from amazon for a macbook pro. I received a cheap, no name brand clear rubber keyboard cover for a macbook white. it came in a bag that said ""Wireless Accessories"" on it. that's all it said. the same bag that the no name brand cell phone cases come in. certainly not a presentable package. I was displeased to say the least, and no company name was available for me to ship it back to, or exchange."	0
That's N-i-e-t-z-s-c-h-e, and what he wrote bears no relation to this movie.In this stinker, all the men seem like predators, or are unappealing at best, all the women are victims. If this is reality--the reality of L.A. or anywhere, I want no part of it. In my experience, people from most classes have some kind of spark or charm. This is a film that mistakes vileness and vapid, blank suffering for profundity or realism.Watch them suffer! On second thought, don't! The most unappealing group of people I've ever fast-forwarded through in recent memory--even worse than The Hawk is Dying.I like dark films--but this is just rub yer nose in it vile and stupid.Avoid at all costs! Yech!	0
This book by Gregg Braden is fantastic in the best possible way. It is packed with answers that make sense. I had originally borrowed the book from my spiritual teacher, and I had to remove many sticky notes that I had used to mark important information when I returned it, months late. I had no choice but to get my own copy. I will re-read this a number of times, and I have returned to select passages many times already. Thank you Gregg, for sending this information out into this world!	1
I totally agree with the positive reviews above. Until I found this face moisturizer, I had terrible problems with flaky dry patches combined with oily places. I tried lots of other moisturizers but nothing provided the kind of complete solution for my complexion. I LOVE THIS LOTION and can't believe it's been discontinued. It is not at all greasy - it feels light and soothing all day long. I also hope Eucerin reconsiders it's decision regarding this amazing product.	1
I grew up on the Narnia Books and thought The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe was well adapted to the big screen. However, Prince Caspian seemed to try to add all of the adventures of current box office hits rather than going with the strength of the story. Everything seemed too over the top: the battlescenes, the attempt at a love line between Caspian and Susan, the lack of quality character improvement. Urf. The scenery and cinematography don't make up for the lack of substance. If they can't pull it together for Dawn Treader, this will be a movie series to miss...	0
Like some of them for this piece of [junk]. It's fabulous. It solved all of my problems. Next thing you know these fools will be trying to convince you that it'll eliminate world hunger. I bought one of these and used it maybe 5 times in about 2 months with my smartmedia card. After that it just stopped working. I know it was connected correctly because the drives continued to map to it, but when I inserted either card and tried to access the data on it I was given a message to insert a card. Avoid this product	0
The special effects were great; however, the plot was slow moving. I was bored with the story line. John Constantine running around using crosses and other religious items was not believable because he didn't believe in God. He cherishes and has faith in created religious objects but has no faith in God. This is equivalent to making a movie about Spiderman but not having him get bitten by the spider, or making about about Luke Skywalker without him using the force. Constantine's holy incantations seemed like a bunch of voodoo mumbo jumbo. Anyone who knows anything about the bible should know that if you are going to make a fictional work off of it, at least get the core principles down. What was good about the movie is the fact that it showed that you don't have to work your way into heaven. It showed that although you may have a lot of faults, God will accept you where you are in life. All you have to do is accept Him.	0
This warmer was such a bargain and does exactly what I want it to do... keeps my cup or mug of coffee warm beside me as I work on my computer. I only gave it four stars because its surface seems uneven... my cups/mugs all rock a bit when sitting on it, and it's wearing along one edge. But that doesn't seem to affect its performance!	1
This book is not on the FRM reading list. The author already has one book for the GARP exam, and this one covers all the same material in much the same manner. There is little that is new here. It is just regurgitating the same stuff. The message seems to be that, if you can't make sense of his first book, you should shell out $100 to give him a second chance. Save your money. It is not worth it.	0
This item loses air overnight. Must be inflated daily if not nightly. If you return this item the store won't take it back, you must ship to the maker at your expense. Or you must cut the air pump out because they don't trust you not to keep using it, like we have to trust them on their quality.	0
this song is ok nothing special. vocally ain't much to Cassie,but the Lyrics&overall vibe make this song work.	0
I have no problem with these diapers on my child, however, I wish I had ordered a smaller size because he happened to transition to size 3 shortly after this purchase. Just bad timing. Otherwise, great product!	1
not as great as i thought. brought it because it was costing me $10 per tube. have been applying it for about 3 weeks now and saw little difference. you have to keep reapplying the gel to get some type of a result. i had used other products just once for about 6 months and they had worked much better - buy the more expensive stuff (maxforce or advion), dont go for their price!	0
This book not only kept me reading and reading, it also was suspenseful and thrilling. Emily was a truly wonderful character and all of the other characters had colorful personalities as well. If you like suspense and romance too, get this book today! You'll absolutely love it.	1
This book is not like he rest of Dale Carnegie's books. The rest of hem are interesting and easy reeds. This'd one is bad	0
These holders have saved my Canasta game! I thought that I would have to give up card playing when the arthritis in my hands became so painful, but these sturdy little holders saved the day. Very easy to use.	1
all right. i admit it. i don't get it. i had never heard of her before that irritating commercial started airing 500 times a day. i keep the remote handy just so i won't hear her bland, uninspired, amateurish rendition of a great stones song. this cd is all fluff. where's the emotion? what, does her dad own the studio?	0
This little heater works far better than I'd hoped. I tested it in my toughest space, the 10 x 40 glassed front porch. For three nights, the outside temp was right at 27. The radiator on its highest setting kept the porch temp at 60! In other, smaller, rooms getting a cozy heat is no big deal. The only noise it makes is an occasional (low) click. I'd have given it five stars if the dial were easier to read, and it had a handle on both sides instead of one.	1
"I love swaddlers, so after finally getting to the end of the initial stash of pampers from the baby showers etc, I started purchasing them. They cost more than other diapers, but oh well I was hooked.I got the grand idea in my head that ""Oh, baby dry? they must work even BETTER than swaddlers, DRY is right in the name!""Wrong. In a swaddler my kid could pee 2-3x and no leakage. In the baby dry, I don't know what it is about them, if she got to peeing a second time? Good lord get that thing off of her quick or she's going to leak or please no zues, oprah, or a tiny baby jesus, don't let her poop because it IS coming out the back even if I have her in a size too big without the back rolled down.I ened up using these as Daycare diapers, because there she got changed ever hour (No worries, I usually check her ever 2 hours max or at the first whiff of poop at home but that wasn't enough for baby dry)Not ever getting those things again and if they're gifted I am regifting."	0
Ok, first of all Mr.Cmndrnineveh from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania USA I find it very hard to believe that you even read the full book version of THE ODYSSEY. God knows if you did you wouldnt be madly in love with this made-for-TV movie THE ODYSSEY. Personally i think the only ppl this movie does good too are druggies and wanna-be drop outs who dont want to read the book or buy the cliff notes so they watch the movie. its absolutley horrible. Mr. Noteboom is a very bright and brillant honors teacher in Washington state. I must say i agree with every honor student's last year review of this book. To the point where Telemachous was whiny and horrible; Athena had blue eyes; and Menelaos' hair is black. All i gotta say is what a waste of film! Ppl out there- spare yourself.	0
Only the Clay-maniacs will like this one. It is simply horrible. I give it two stars, being generous, because I like Clay and I think he can sing. The material is bad. Did they MAKE him sing these poorly written songs? If you bought the single 'Bridge Over Troubled Water' then you bought the best of Clay, this I am sorry, is not.	0
I didn't realize that so many of his ideas are used, without knowing where they came from. Thanks for sending this book.	1
Piece of crap. All functions did not work when opened and stopped working during first use... horrible product. California Exotics should be ashamed of selling this junk. do not waste your money or shipping..	0
I bought one a few days ago. It has already 'left' me three times. Once was after a few hours while I was trying to feed it. It seems really buggy, my items keep disappearing, and sometimes it doesn't reward the neopoints. I'm going to be taking it back, and wouldn't recommend it to anybody who's frustrated easily.	0
I don't think the product does what they say it will do which makes it a very expensive bottle of oil. The program would not let me submit wtih no stars, which is what I would give the product based on the claims for the products usage.	0
When I first saw this movie I thought. The Girl gets captured by Bowser and Mario has to rescue her and Luigi tags along. Well I was sadly mistaken. This has to be one of the worst Video game to theatre movies I've ever seen. It has nothing to do with the mario games. I don't recall them having booster boots and I don't recall springy mushroom. And Yoshi's a baby raptor what's that about. If they would have made it a little better this would have been great. Shame Touchstone Pictures Shame.	0
Hard to tell from the picture what size this is. I thought it was much larger. It would not hold much more than a 1/2 pound of coffee. Too much space is wasted for the filter holder section.	0
I bought this book as a gift for my daughter. She was thrilled when she opened it. We had been looking for this book in local bookstores and was unable to find it here. I should of looked at amazon a long time ago. Thank you for helping me to make my daughters christmas a little brighter.	1
"This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers""."	0
I was really stoked to watch this movie. And I honestly enjoyed the first half of the it - the setup. I love the actors here. The look and feel of the picture was great, dug the vibe. A bunch of strangers come together for an insomnia experiment in a haunted house in New England. The Dr, Liam Neeson hasn't told them that he wants to study their reaction to fear. They stay in the house a couple of days and it begins to have an effect on them. Lili Taylor's charactor in particular.That's about as far as I can go w/o spoilage. I'll just say it becomes predictable haunted house story after that. I didn't get the thrills I was expecting. Such interesting characters. Such potential. I've rarely seen a movie that was such a let down.	0
This movie kicks a** all the way and I can't wait for this to come out on DVD because it's an excellent movie!	1
I was hesitant to buy this one, as I thought their first album was just OK, but since I knew they were talented, I rolled the dice. Once it entered my car player, it stayed there for over a week straight. (That can only happen with a great opening track, which this of course has) Great vocals, lyrics, driving rhythm section, even a semi drum solo that is mixed in a cool stereo manner. I dig this album, hope you do too.	1
...and the ending really sank the series. I wish he'd have stopped with the original trilogy. Ursula LeGuin made the same mistake with the Earthsea books: three brilliant and a fourth turkey. This is the turkey, and Asimov kept fowling up after it. Bummer.	0
This book by Tom Bodett was long and it took awhile to get to the action. It dragged on and on while it was about page 160 when the short action part started. Although it did have a few good parts to it, this book was a novel that seemed to drag on and on.When Ivan and September get left alone at their small remote home on the shores of Alaska, 12 year old Ivan messes up the raidos. The raidos are the kid's only source of communtian, and their only way to interact with the outside world.While then they have to make many trips back and fourth to the outer world, it takes much time to get to the interesting parts.Overall, this book had some good parts to it, but wasn't the best book I have ever read.	0
I bought this rice cooker 3 months ago and was very careful to only use the white spoon provided to remove rice/porridge.

"I just got my 2007 edition copy of ""Interpretation of Dreams"" in the mail so I haven't had a chance to read it. So this rating is only on the particular edition that is published by NuVision. They did not include an index or any information about who translated this version. Also, the table of contents is nearly worthless; no detail what-so-ever about the chapters, not even titles of the chapters, just Chapter 1 etc. and a page number. Even though you may think a newer publication is better, this one is much much worse and more expensive. Go with the 1980 publication. I'm returning the book to Amazon (who gets 5 stars for customer service!)"	0
"Don't let the sleek look of the emarker fool you, it's got bugs a-plenty and some serious design flaws. Here's what the other reviews (written by Sony employees?) and the literature don't say:* E-marker doesn't seem to work with AOL; you have to not only use another browser, but also set that browser as the default.* When you plug the emarker into your computer, it ""automatically"" loads your marks into the site...or at least that's what it's supposed to do. On 3 browsers and 2 different computers, I haven't quite gotten this to happen.* Sony seems to be more concerned about being cool than functional - to top off all the emarkers' inadequacies, they (over)designed a Flash interface to get your songs that doesn't quite work either. Simple HTML would have been fine, guys....Spare yourself the agony and wait for version 2.0....this is the first time I've been irate enough about something to write a review and I assure you everything above is true..."	0

If there was any question of whether Nietzsche was an absolute genius, these two books will prove it. His wit, enthusiasm, courage, and extreme energy will keep you enthralled in his arguments. These are the two works by Nietzsche that give him his reputation as an extremist and genius.	1
I didn't finish watching this feature because I couldn't get past the crappy audio. The vocals in this movie sound like the actors are talking into a large empty tin can, combine that with the UK accents I really couldn't make out what was going on, but half way through when I checked out all the characters had done was drive, get loaded and fool around.(There's two guys and two girls involved)	0
I have to say, I'm a bit surprised it took me so long to get to this series, being the fan I am ... now im excited to have another great series ahead of me. A very convincing, modern take on the madness of Victor Frankenstein. Worth every minute.	1
"This is an utterly poor effort by an aging hero. Dee Dee is obviously a very sloppy guitar player, he sings bad (not to speak of his wife Barbara's ""vocals"") and the songs.. well, they sully the memory of the Ramones' work on classical albums like ""Ramones"", ""Leave Home"" and ""Rocket To Russia"". Even die-hard-fans should hesitate to buy this..."	0
The story is a very simple one but the action, so to speak, doesn't really happen until the final third of the book. It was a battle to get through the dry middle!Unfortunately the story is also exceptionally easy to guessand the turns of the story are not surprising in the least.On the plus side, the book gives a good glimpse at life in Puritan early American communities and their moral strucutres.	0
I loved this book. The picture Jean Auel paints is of an ancient world in a time of change. She makes the characters real, you can sense and identify with their emotions. Hurry with that next book	1
As to be expected of a book endorsed by Edwin Meese and George Bush, this book talks about how to permit right wing fascism by undermining the balance of power afforded by the Judicial Branch. Phyllis is in her typical form, blasting judges for such things as ending segregation and protecting human rights. Like another reviewer said, past the title there is nothing new. If you want to see where people like Reverend Pat Mahoney, Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell get their ideas of how to destroy this country by breaking down the balance of power so that they can build a murderous Theocracy, this book is for you.	0
"I absolutely love Clay's voice, and I couldn't wait for the release of this disappointing debut. But the nuances of his voice that make it so phenomenal are hidden underneath the ""music."" I would rather hear Clay singing acappella or singing just about anything other than these songs. Why cover up such a beautiful voice?"	0
The DVD was fine - it would be useful if you explained about the regions and how you have to change your dvd program to watch the dvd.	0
When you saw the previews for this movie, you probably did think it was a bunch of pretty woman dancing on a bar. It's NOT. It's a sweet story about a girl trying to seek her dream of being a songwriter. She needs to move to a new place to try to have her songs be heard, and ends up working as a coyote. Also with this tale is lots of fun and enjoyment. At the end, you can't forget when LeAnn Rimes comes in as a country music sensation (herself) and performs Violet's song she recorded. I highly suggest anyone should by this, and don't forget to pick up the soundtrack too!	1
WHY, WHY, WHY does it always have to be the shows I hate so much to take the world by storm?! Rocko's Modern Life is a LOT better than Spongebob! I can't believe that they even LIED about Rocko making an appearance in this movie! For all you Spongebob fans: BOYCOTT SPONGEBOB NOW! ROCKO IS BETTER!	0

Fits ok. Stretches on easily (does not snap). No cut outs for any of the buttons on the middle of the phone (Palm Treo 755p) Can't see the power, green, five way, or the menu buttons. You either have to remember where they are, or use a fine blade to cut out the holes. Matte black. Will offer some protection against scratches. It does fit the qwerty keyboard nicely, no obstruction of any of these keys. Also no obstruction of the camera lens. Can't open the card slot-cut out too small. OK for now, but will keep looking for one that fits correctly.	0
I had to read this when I was in high school. So did my children. Now my GRANDCHILDREN have to read it! None of us has been able to discover WHY! Of all of the superb books I have read in my life, not ONE has ever been selected for required summer reading!	0
I took my zen back after a week of problems.It's really fussy about id3 tags, which is a problem if some of you collection didn't come _directly_ off cd. I fiddled around with various automated taggers, but never got things working to satisfaction. The player crashes every 3 to 8 hours of operation and frequently takes 20+ minutes rebuilding it's database of tracks after a crash (i hear this process is made long by incomplete id3 tags).Two days ago the left headphone channel started cutting out, as it has for many other reviewers. That was the last straw. I'm over it, thinking about a rio Karma or nothing at all.	0
1) both units require power. the camera does have a 9v adpt but not the receiver. 2) there is always a line of interferance on the monitor cause by noise. Not a good picture.3) Picture quality is not clear, grainy and dis-colored4) 1st range test was only about 50' from base which was located in my bedroom and the camera stopped transmitting in my drive way. I will test it outside later5) ther is no on board memory storage, so you'll have to set up a computer or something.good luck..	0
I was given this book as a gift and as a redhead myself I was excited to read it. All I can say is that I am glad I did not pay good money for it. The writing is so bad and pointless and does nothing to prove a point or even tell a story. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS BOOK!	0
This is the second Steve Berry novel I have read, and this was certainly better than the Amber Room. The plot is intriguing and the story held my interest through the end of the novel.The downside to this novel is that the Third Secret isn't all that shocking, and for the second straight novel, there's a five letter word to describe the personality of the lead female character. Is Berry a misogynist or was he going through a divorce while drafting these novels?Also, the antagonists are almost cartoonish. How or why did these individuals become priests in the first place?	1

"My friend had a PET except it was blue. It is unbelievable!!! The only bad thing about it is that u have to shake it 15 minutes to even fight a virus! I want red which is the ""#2"" PET. U should get it. My friend said that he made up a chip called the ""sinqule chip."" He made this ""dementional area"" to do this special power. It's called ""down fusion."" He says that it wastes all off your energy, but in one shot... it defeats the guy your versing! He says only one guy has it. HIM!!!!!! I think he's lieing. But remember... get it!"	1
The soles and laces of these sandals do not flex with your feet. Says it is leather but the laces feel like plastic. Very uncomfortable especially for dancing. Thin soled or would be good for every day use.	0
"This CD is so fantastic. Great songs for everyone! My favorite 'The Way"" also loved ""Touch"" (sounds like Marc Antony),and ""Perfect Day"" (sounds like the Beatles). I also really liked ""When You say You Loved Me"", very catchy."	1
I read this book in elementary school. I loved it. I've now purchased it for my kids!	1
You will not be disappointed with the construction of the bike rack. It's made from very strong and light material that doesn't rust. It fit perfectly on my SUV. I placed 2 bikes on it and drove 70mph on the freeway without a problem. When I stopped to check the bikes, all the tie cables were still tightly fastened and both bikes were in proper placement.There are a couple of downsides however. You might find it difficult to place 3 bikes on there. Also if you own a women's bike, it will sit on the rack at an angle. When it sits at an angle, it makes it difficult to get the third clamp (stabilizer) fastened.	1
I had mixed reviews of this product. It most definitely got the job done, and fast! The only qualms that I had was that it was really large and hard to get in sometimes. Also I found that the rabbit ears would get in the way and could become annoying at times, but other than that it is a GREAT product.	1
A little over a week of use, I noticed a bad diaper rash that rapidly progressed to blisters. They healed when I switched to a different diaper and broke out again when I tried to go back to using this diaper. I'm giving two stars because pampers agreed to refund my money even though I was outside the week window to return them to Amazon and because according to Pampers, this is the same formula they have been using for 20 years, which means they were my favorite diapers for my daughter.	0
I was hoping to find another series that would be similar to Diana Gabaldon's books, but I was very disappointed. I still have not found anyone who writes like Gabaldon. I'll make this short and sweet in that I do not think that Donati has developed her characters as well as she could. I wanted the story to be wrapped more around Elizabeth and Nathaniel, but instead, much of the story came from Hannah's point of view. I realize this is probably due to the fact that Hannah's character is being built for an upcoming book, but I was not interested. Elizabeth's character was developed well, but I felt in both Into the Wilderness and Dawn on a Distant Shore, that Nathaniel did not have as strong of a character and hero image as I would have liked. I just did not feel the passion between these two as I had hoped. Even the ending was very weak to me.	0
Once you get past the hype, you will realize this device is a [$] clock. When you press the button on the e-marker, it only records the time, not the radio station. When you download the information to your computer and connect to the website it looks for the song that was played on the station how many hours/days ago you pressed the button. If you selected the wrong station you will get a different song.If you use the scan button on your radio, this product is not for you	0
The ring sizes run much smaller than the usual and the ring is so wide that you can't close your hand when it is on. Returning the item was even more difficult. While I returned it within one week of purchase, it took 7 weeks and a complaint filed with Amazon to get my refund. If you do purchase from this seller & ultimately have to return something be very sure you get a tracking number or receipt confirmation. Without that I would still be waiting for my money.	0
This was one of the very first things I crocheted. The gusset was a little confusing until I realized the gusset illustration was in the beginning of the booklet. My socks came out great and my mom is already asking for a second pair, so I'll probably try a different style.	1
This is a fictional account of a true event in history, but it is loaded with factual imformation. If you enjoy reading conspiracy theories you will love this book. The questions raised in the book are quite interesting. The reader should have fun trying to separate the fictional events from the factual ones. Many have described it as a real page-turner.	1
As a reader of historical romance, a civil war buff, and a fan of the Outlander series author Diana Gabaldon, who once recommended this book on her web site, I came to this novel fully expecting to like it. I was severely disappointed. This is a middling, at best, romance novel with a pedestrian plot, predictable characters, and a hero and heroine who couldn't be more representative of all that's tedious in the genre. The author seems sincere and there's a sense that she did her civil war era research, but the book holds no surprises and little inducement for the reader to continue past the first few chapters.If you're going to write a novel about another spirited, plain but beautiful, impoverished girl-woman who makes a marriage of convenience with a gorgeous, tortured, secretly-sensitive man who-pretends-to-hate-but-really-loves-her than it better be exquisitely plotted and beautifully written. This book is neither.	0
Great film with two great actors. Funny, witty, charming. Allows you to see that although education may make you smarter, it doesn't necessarily make you better.	1
Ok, for all those people who aren't good at playing video games and would like to stick to the unrealistic NBA live 2003 where it takes you 3 seconds to get down court, stay off this game. NBA 2k3 is a great game. I could do the franchise mode all day! There is great graphics, and great gameplay. The ESPN setting makes it even better. For sega sports fans this is a great buy!	1
If you have not read this book yet, you are missing out. This book by Ray Bradbury exposes you to why books are very important. A must read.	1
Pros:Works amazing! Love it. Uses wireless internet connection to upload the show times and titles.Highly suggest this product if your looking for a wireless adapter for your TiVo.Was a plug and play periphrial. Plug it in and your Series2 TiVo finds it right away.Great product and experience. Much like every TiVo product I own.Cons:The price seems a little steep but not too bad because it works like a charms	1
The evidence is not yet in whether these are doing anything for me, but it is supposed to take up to six months so I am patiently waiting. In the meantime, I can say that the price is right compared to other retail suppliers' formulations and that delivery has been prompt and reliable.	1
Everyone seems to have the same problem with this rice cooker. It just dies after 1-2 years. Ours is worthless now. Bought a simple one for $13, works just as well. DO NOT BUY!!	0
This album is great man. No one can do it like Tego. Lyrics, beats are all great. He brings the best of evrything down and drops it like no other. Ya should also check out Don Omars King Of Kings another crazy album.	1
thanks for sending it promptly,it arrived much quicker than i thought it would and so i was able to give it as a Christmas present ,God bless from daithi	1
This movie stinks. It was so bad that I hope I never have to watch it again for the rest of my life.	0
"All of the good things said about ""Helter Skelter"" is true of the Kindle edition. What's more the Kindle edition has hyperlinked footnotes that actually work and take you instantly to Bugliosi's notes. But the trade-off is that with the Kindle edition THERE ARE NO PICTURES because of licensing issues. The print edition has lots of pictures, but many of the crime-scene photo's are censored."	1
"Classic Jazz Piano was previously owned on a tape which eventually died I was pleased that the same much liked music was still available in cd not only as a download and at a reasonable price this will encourage me to 'up date "" some more of my ageing collection"	1
These diapers have a design flaw. When my baby has a BM, a small amount seeps through the diaper so I put two of these on so her clothes do not get messy.	0
Orwell's 1984 is the best reason for people to read. It demonstrates clearly and horrifically what can happen to an uneducated society that allows itself to be controlled due to it's own fear of initiative. Anyone who asks me why I read is automatically referred to this book, which is as important now as it was when it was written.	1

Clay's voice is effortless, true, and glides through each song like silk. He is being true to himself, and honoring his fans. Randy Jackson said it best; it's THAT VOICE. That's all you need to know.	1
"I gave this record a few listen and unfortunately it was not to my liking. This album is NOT what Voivod is supposed to sound. Eric Forrest brought in a ""death metal"" like voice into the band, Piggy and Away composed most of the music. This album is kinda like a re-hash on 'War and Pain' with all the ""death metal-esque"" vocals and has very poor mix. The mix sounded like all the guitars, bass and drums are overlapping Eric Forrest's vocals. You can bearly hear him singing. This album is pretty sloppy to my liking. Eric Forrest's singing is unlike Snake and his bass techniques are unlike Blacky. His techniques are not bad, but not great either. It's NOT what Voivod should have sounded like on this album. True Voivodians would be disapointed."	0
okay, first of all it works, but the thing is that the antenna it comes with is sort of short, i mounted it to the top of my case, but it just looks sketchy.Secondly, the antenna broke on me today, and if you dont have the antenna connected to the pci screw in-no wireless... the screw in (with the little black tape that goes around the wire) is very sensitive almost to the point where its unfair. and like i said, no antenna no connection. my antenna broke off at the base and it makes the wireless pci care useless.And lastly, like i mentioned before the antenna looks like something out of the 80's with a little cliche tabletop design, but i just mounted it to the top of my case, and it still gets in the way when i take my case out to work on it.Im sure that this wireless card works fine connectivity and signal and all that, but once your antenna breaks its all over- NO MORE CONNECTION	0
"I should have glanced at this book's format before I wasted my hard-earned dollars on this junk. It's simply a huge heap of quotes, regurgitated in some order known only to the authors. The ""story"" (simply interviews ad infinitum) unfolds by seasons of the show, without any sort of context, without any stab at putting the times in any perspective, without a clue, often, how the lesser-known characters contributed.It quickly became a very frustrating read, and then became one that left me shaking my head in disbelief.It would have been a good story if the outside world had been permitted to enter into it. But it doesn't. I know the writers aren't lazy, look at all this verbiage!, but it doesn't add up to a hill of beans. Dang, the ratings system doesn't allow one to enter NO stars at all. Save your money. Terrible."	0
In a word- horrible. I am a HUGE fan of the first two. Watched the cartoons as a kid, and i really couldn't wait to see this movie. It was horrible. Rambling, incoherent, and unfocused. I missed Megan Fox every minute that pouty, big-lipped female was talking, and fell asleep after 20 minutes.	0
Really nice portable bed, I don't wanna back sleeping in a regular bed!!!. I highly recommend this item for everybody who is looking for a good bed to be sleeping like a baby.	1
I just heard Vaneese Thomas sing on the Mall in Washington, DC. Her voice is so powerful and yet in the next breath angelic. The lyrics of her songs touch me deeply. They encourage me and reveal a close, personal walk with God. This CD is a must have for every music lover. It's the next best thing to hearing her live!	1
Do computer generated things scare you? They don't scare me.Do sets scare you? They don't scare me either.I understand that studios can't make money re-releasing old classics in theatres because of home video but why spend all that money trying to remake or even surpass something that is obviously the sum of its human parts, all of whom you won't or can't reuse?Isn't that like trying to be the first man on the moon - - - -again?Some scriptwriters and directors could make a biscuit and a glass of milk frightening.They used a super computer called talent.Please reboot.	0
The performance of all actors, especially Gerard Depardieu is top-notch. The story has a sad ending, but thought provoking. The excitement, energy and the fierce determination of Jean de Florette is inspiring. This city dweller is so determined to succeed as a farmer that he will give up under no circumstance. Beware that the French spoken in this movie is not the Parisian French, the Provence accent makes it very hard to understand, in case you are a student of French. (There are French subtitles too, besides English, so that helps a lot).	1
This item is not worth the money. It takes between 80 and 120 minutes to cook brown rice. My $49.00 Sunbeam steamer that I purchased 5 years ago cooks rice much better than the Zojirushi.	0
To be honest, between the forced dialogue and the constant, graphic child abuse scenes, there's not a lot of content here. In fact, I dare say the abuse doesn't even progress the story, but uses shock value to keep readers interested. The love is fake, the story never has any hope, and the ending is an outrage. Nothing is solved, nothing is concluded - it's all just so the author can sell the next book. No, thank you.	0
"I need to preface this review by saying that I never received myZojirushi NS-ZCC18 from Amazon. Twice they sent me the oldermodel, the NS-ZAC18 instead. All the while their website claimsthat they have plenty of inventory, and that it ships within24 hours. Repeated calls to Amazon get plenty of sympatheticresponses, but no action. THE BOTTOM LINE: Amazon advertisesproducts that it does not actually carry.This seems to be a common theme with Amazon recently, somethingtantamount to a bait-and-switch. It also occurred when I orderedthe ""Ultimate Rice Cooker Cookbook"" and had to wait a week for itto ship, even though they claim it was in stock. I finallyreceived an e-mail that there was an unspecified ""problem""with the order. I called Amazon and was told that they had justreceived a couple copies and one would be mine -- remember, thewhole time before this their site claimed ""In Stock, ships in 24hours"".Not good business practice."	0
"I remembered Roger Rabbit from years back. I picked it up just to wander back to the silly but clever animation in ""Roger Rabbit"". I was also aware of the background situation where General motors bought up most of the trolley lines, in order to force a transition to use their buses. All in all, I laughed again just as the first time I saw it. While not a flick that is looked at every month, it is a nice break in the usual Hollywood dramas. Let yourself enjoy it without letting the plot put you to sleep."	1
"I remember when seeing two women together, supporting and caring for each other was very, very rare. The most compelling part in this movie is where Lillian and Julia meet in the cafe. Julia tells Lillian that she has named her daughter for her. Julia finally reaches over and puts her hand on Lillian's and says ""My beloved friend. Go!"" Yet another potent reminder of the courage of the Resistance fighters in the face of Nazi terror. Jason Robards is incredible, and for those of us who grew up near Long Island beaches, it's a wonderful recollection of them. Buy it for your daughters."	1
"Haiku is a Japanese lyric with a deceptively simple form: 17 syllables in three lines of 5,7,5 syllables. Strictly speaking, a haiku must contain a ""season word"" and restrict itself to condensed, defined, natural imagery. Those are the outward rules, and they are rules which can be (and are) broken. It is in the inward force of a rich combination of Taoism, Buddhism and Shintoism that gives haiku it's power and grace. THE HAIKU YEAR, while an interesting experiment, is problematic in that much of it appears to imitate haiku and the powerful subtlety for which haiku is known is simply not there. Aspiring haiku writers would do better to consult the translations by R.H. Blyth, THE HAIKU ANTHOLOGY (of English language haiku) by Cor van den Heuvel, and the indispensable and well-respected THE HAIKU HANDBOOK by William Higginson."	0
After two go bad experiences with this product, all I can say is do not buy anything from Macally, at all. The first AC adapter for my G4 laptop went bad within 6 months and the second AC adapter was shot in less than five. When I say this product is junk, I'm not exaggerating. Basically, when you started to hear a high pitch whine, that was all she wrote. Within a week or so, the unit was dead. After the second one went dead I contacted Macally's customer service representative which was an exercise in futility. I was stonewalled at every turn. I finally just asked them to send me a new unit and they demanded proof of purchase. I then offered to send the old unit in but they wanted a receipt. All of this for a twenty dollar AC adapter. I'm sure this guy has a lot of practice giving his customers the shaft by virtue of the other bad reviews for this product. Do yourself a huge favor and do not buy anything from Macally.	0
I have been looking for this CD for years. We use to have it in cassette form and somehow lost it. It's a great CD for travelling, expecially in the Mountains.Thank you Amazon.com	1
Ordered these for my husband, it's his 2nd pair. He wore the 1st pair into the ground over several years so pretty good value.	1
Decent product. I had to sleep on it for a few nights and I survived. It is comfortable enough to pass out on It stayed inflated the whole night and deflates well. It comes with a sack for storage, though my folding skills are pretty lame, so fitting it into the bag is a challenge for me.	1
This is from a student's point of view. I'm not a 'reader' type, so this book, for me, was awful. I can see how people might like it, the storyline is great, all the themes and everything, but the thing about this book that turned it down for me was Hawthorne's style. Coming from a time where authors get paid by the word, lets just say, it takes him AGES to get his point across.	0
I have to admit that I have real problems with books that lack editing. This is a case in point. This book is difficult to read because of all the grammatical and spelling errors. Misplaced modifiers abound, too. Perhaps these errors have been corrected in subsequent printing, but at least, the one that I read had multiple errors on nearly every page. By the way, what is with spaces between paragraphs?Living on the North Coast as I do, I understand that people living in Ohio might find the story intriguing because of the subject matter; however, I found it difficult to enjoy the story because of the stilted conversations and implausible situations.	0
This is a wonderful read. It makes a great bedtime story and it is also beautiful (the wood carvings) and inspiring. This is good for people tired of reading what is wrong with the environment. The Man Who Planted Trees is kind of like a sophisticated Lorax book. Anyway, buy this book and enjoy it!	1
I'll try to make it short and sweet: good book that is ultimately marred by a terrible chapter on the JonBenet Ramsey murder. For most of the chapter, Mr. Douglas spends his time attacking the theories (and character) of other credible law enforcement officials who have called him out for the illogical findings he presented while being paid by the Ramsey's lawyers. Frankly, it's a little embarrassing. You blew it, John...and you know it.Just glad to see others posting similar comments about the final (and regrettable chapter) of this book. It's amazing to see someone with so much skill and experience really just, well, crap the bed like this.	0
"One Hundred Years of Solitude chronicles 100 years of a family (of Buendia) and a village (city) that the ""first of the family line"" founded. The prose is lyrical and flows as smoothly as a river. That is, sometimes there are rapids and other times calm. The genre is magical realism, and it is fascinating watching the magic evolve with the family and village. After finishing this book, I'm not 100% certain what Marquez meant by it, though. It has anti-war and anti-oppressive-regime themes, but there's something more that I haven't quite put my finger on yet. I may need to re-read it after letting it settle for a while."	1
What a disappointment. This book is about 50% self-centered travelogue and 50% teasers about the mysteries. I expected a book full of archeological information about cities and cultures that have long since disappeared, but instead got embarrassingly ridiculous chit-chat and superficial explanations. I wanted scientific information, not a book that tends to explain most of its mysteries via levitation and alien beings!	0
THIS BOOK IS A GREAT CLASSIC THAT EXPLOITS THE IDEA THAT A PREACHER WOULD DO THE UNTHINKABLE AND MAKE A WOMAN PREGNANT WHO HE WAS NOT MARRIED TO. THE SPIRIT IS WILLING BUT THE FLESH IS WEAK. I LIKE THE CANDID REALITY OF THIS BOOK THAT DID NOT WHITE-WASH EVERYTHING COMPLETELY AND THE STORY STILL MAKES SENSE IN THE MODERN WORLD, THIS STILL HAPPENS EVEN TO THIS DAY. HOWEVER, THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR IS THE WORST POSSIBLE OUTCOME AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT NOT TO DO.	1
"WHAT IS THERE TO SAY ABOUT A CD WHEN ENGELBERT FINALLY RELEASES IT? IT IS SIMPLY THE BEST!!THE TITLE SONG ""DEFINITION OF LOVE"" IS SO BEAUTIFUL AND ENGE DELIVERS THE LYRICS WITH SUCH EMOTION THAT YOU FEEL THAT HE IS RIGHT NEAR YOU. HIS RENDITION OF GARTH BROOK'S ""IF TOMORROW NEVER COMES"" BRINGS A TEAR TO YOUR EYE ANDTHE DEPTH OF HIS EMOTION WHEN HE SINGS THIS SONG IS TOOOO MUCH!!IT JUST IS SO BEAUTIFUL!!I'M SO THANKFUL THAT GOD HAS GIVEN HIM THE TALENT WHICH HE CHOOSES TO USE FOR OUR BENEFIT AND WITH THE RELEASE OF THIS 2003CD, HE ONLY GETS BETTER. HIS RANGE, BREATHING, TONE AND ALL IS JUST THOROUGHLY NOTED ON ALL OF THESE SONGS. YOU WILL CERTAINLY ENJOY HEARING HIS TITLE SONG. ENJOY!!"	1
I purchased this battery as a backup for a vacation. It works perfectly. It is indistinguishable from the battery that came with the camera, lasts just as long (one or two days of frequent use), and charges fairly quickly in the standard charger. For folks going on a trip, I recommend taking two batteries for your camera. Just slip the spare into your pocket (not with your loose change or car keys, though) and pop it in when the camera needs it. Charging took a few hours overnight. For European current, my standard charger (not incl) said it takes the local voltage, so I only needed a plug adapter.	1
"I have not heard the CD, yet. (sorry)But have spent some time this afternoon tracking down info on the piece that was played as Pres Reagan was carried from the National Cathedral.It took a bit of searching to come up with a loose title to the piece and some names. But I am not certain that I have the correct score.Can someone verify that the processional piece at the end of the service was a rendition from this CD? Which track?It almost sounded like two items, one with the words ""the mansions of the Lord"" and a second, more eloquent anthem, that they continued to play in cycle.Thank you"	1
I have a strong connection with excellent speed. The show stopped at least 4 times due to signal disruption. I have no problems with connection at any other time. When the video did play, the video was high-def half of the time. I purchased high-def, but it was not good sound or video quality. The price and availability are the advantages.	0
video would not play in either my 3 dvd players so i ordered another video from someone else. the dvd wasn't van helsing. the dvd was constantine and it was fubar. so what is your idea of correcting the bad dvd i received.	0
What can I say that has not already been said. It is a bit dark and too short, but a great effort none the less.	1
The bottle press doesn't allow air intake, which means the more lotion you squeeze out, the more distorted the container will be. Because It's odd that such a good product comes with bad bottle design.	1

"I'd never even heard of ""Legionaire"" until a skit on ""Saturday Night Live"" (where Kris Kattan portrayed VanDamme) made fun of the fact that nobody saw this movie. I of course thought that this movie must be godawful, so I rented it just to be entertained by its horribleness. But I was amazed at what a great movie this was! It was kind of cheesy in places (like those stupid flashbacks that are supposed to be heartwarming and touching but are really just annoying) but the action sequences are really good. I'm surprised that a decent movie like this goes straight to video while other movies which are far more lame and stupid make it to the big screen. If you rent it you won't be disappointed, especially if you have low expectations to begin with"	1
Paper feed is definitely a serious product defect. I called the HP tech support, but they were not aware of the paper feed cleaning kit that some reviewer mentioned. They only suggested cleaning the roller with dampened cloth.Thanks to Michael C Garrett's ingenious solution, this printer is more or less reusable again.	0
"Bought this to install in a 40 Gig, HP Pentium 4 hard drive government surplus computer that is about 2-3 years old. Other than having trouble connecting it with my QWest wireless service (it wouldn't show in the little box they kept telling me to click on even though the wireless card properties said ""the device is working properly""), I got it to connect anyway and this computer now has the fastest internet in the house! It is faster than my brand new Dell that I got last year. I am recommending it to my parents who bought similar surplus computers after seeing how fast the internet was on this computer. I don't think it is the computer though, I think it is the wireless card! It was easy to install, too (and I have never installed anything in a tower before). I am very pleased with it, esp. for the price!"	1
I love buffy it is a great show. anyways u really wanna get this tape because it has ANGEL on it! the episode is great not to mention david b. is HOT!!! thats all for now	1
This book showed me that I dont have to live in LA or New York to get into acting. Also It gave me alot of helpful hints on all aspects in landing a role.	1
"Clay Aiken has to be one of the worst singers ever to come off of American Idol. The songs on his debut CD are all predictible and sleep-inducing. Even William Hung is capable of making a better CD than this drab garbage. With boring singles like ""Invisible"" and ""The Way,"" I can't understand how Americans could make this guy a star. Please, Clay, if you insist on making more music, at least have the decency of doing a nice gay anthem like ""I Will Survive"" or ""YMCA."""	0
"Thinking that I was missing out on a new release of vintage James Brown,I am so glad that I didn't buy the DVD-Body Heat because I already have the VHS, ""James Brown, the Lost Tapes"". I would have been upset to learn that the DVD is the same as the tape. I am constantly looking for new unseen performance material from Mr. Brown while he was in his hey-days, the 60'and 70's."	0
"I read some reviews here and elsewhere that sounded positive, but honestly this film was AWFUL. My friend and I seriously discussed leaving after the first 20 minutes (somthing I have never done before), but decided to stick it out and hope that it would get better. It did, but only marginally. I ended up wishing that I had walked in the first place and not wasted my time and $9.00 on this sea of stupid lines and pointless ""plot"". It was insulting to both Hawaiians and Trans-gender people and most of all was NOT FUNNY, truly. I like Drew Barrymore, and Adam Sandler when he is playing a character with a brain in his head--and there is chemistry between these actors(...). Rent The Wedding Singer instead. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME AND MONEY--if you are over the age of 11 this film is too immature for you. And if you are under the age of 11 you will be bored."	0
I purchased the Mug Warmer as a Christmas gift for a relative. Within a few days after opening the gift, I got a phone call raving about how fantastic and useful this item is. Good idea, and oh so practical.	1
"Ever have one of those albums?An album where you spin it a few times and a few songs might sink-in, but the majority seem wrapped in gauze? Then-- ONE DAY -- it hits you, the genius behind the songs, the hidden melodies, the amazing musicianship?That was my experience with this album. It took 2 years of (very) sporadic listenings to suddenly be hit in the head with just how flat-out AMAZING this album is. A few songs are easy and accessible (ie. ""Captain Easychord""), while others may take a few listens to *really* appreciate--- but it's worth the effort. (as a comparison, I found ""Margerine Eclipse"" very easy to get-into, while it took a while for ""Dots & Loops"" and ""Cobra & Phases"" to really sink-in).Very highly recommended, once it hits you, it will stay with you and grow-stronger with repeat-listens."	1
"I loved this book, but when I got ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"" I was surprised to find ""Making Journals by Hand"" is actually included in that text in full: word for word, page for page, project for project .Instead of buying ""Making Journals by Hand"" and ""Making Memory Boxes"", save some money and buy one book: ""Making Memory Books and Journals by Hand"". This book combines all of the projects above and then some.All of these books have great projects and instructions."	1
Mostly very happy with this product, except the fact that it's dreadfully slow on fast forward or reverse. As you might imagine this can become very frustrating at times. And also totally unable to skip ahead to another part of the recording immediately similar to what the ipod can do.---C'mon Sandisk, give us some software to correct these serious inconveniences!!	1
"Guessthey weren't kidding when they said ""BIG"" babys!Well,yeah I agree that these dolls don't really sent a good message for kids.But regular barbie dolls are now old and some how...childish.Most of the barbies are pretty much same old ""Princess"" stuff.ANd since sales haven't been doing too well,Mattel has been rushing and making dumb movies.Anyway The doll is really big.It's lips (lIke every other bratz doll)are huge.THe legs of this doll and big and fat.The skirt too short.She seems to have big hips,I rather have the small bratz dolls."	0
I've had this outside my kitchen door for a couple of months. It's great at cleaning shoes (I do a lot of gardening and yard work), it's holding up well, and the rubber base is very solid.	1
"I was expecting the author to continue with some Dickensian darkness and magical whimsey. The darkness was certainly delivered...and with heaping doses of vulgarity to boot. A dry read most certainly NOT reminiscent of the tone of ""A Christmas Carol""--as one is led to expect by the book's abstract--I stopped reading it after the fourth chapter and haven't missed it at all!"	0
Held my attention for an airplane ride (hence 2 stars), but I was sincerely disappointed for the last third. Kept reading because I didn't think any author would be that brazen. Trivializes current political / social / religous arguments to an insulting degree.	0
Nothing about this La Traviata was bad. Many things were even quite good (I was particularly pleased that they kept Alfredo's father's second aria, which is usually cut out!), but there were more that were simply unremarkable.If this was the only video of La Traviata available I would be well pleased with it. It is satisfactory and, on stage, it was probably excellent. The only thing about it that really bothered me was that Alfredo, his father, and Violetta all looked about the same age and that would not, I think, have been apparent from the audience.However, there are several versions that are considerably better. This version is well worth seeing if you are interested in multiple interpretations of this opera, but if you wish to see only one, let it be a different one. There are three that I think are equally good: the version with Placido Domingo and Theresa Stratas, the version with Anna Moffo (though it has no subtitles), and a fairly new version with Jose Cura.	1
Do not purchase from this seller. Horrible service. It took them over a month to ship me my filter and didn't even compensate me with free shipping. When I asked what the hold up was they told me they left me a voice message (which they didn't) and that my order would be reshipped due to shipping failure. This was their fault and I didn't even receive an apology. Very disappointed and will never purchase from them again.	0
This book has 59 tours in the Yosemite, Kings Canyon, and Sequoia National Park areas and around Huntington Lake. Describes some beautiful country. Each tour is rated with difficulty, length, elevatnion, navigation, time, and season. The USGS topos for the tour are listed, along with excellent tour maps. Each tour has a description of what you see, where to start, and leads you thorough the tour.I like the book, but I would also like to see an index and more tours for the Yosemite high country.	1
This one makes too small and too fine a grind of pepper to be useful in cooking. You'll be cranking away on this thing for ten minutes before you get enough crushed pepper to flavor anything.	0
I bought this backpack when I wanted to have a new bag for my laptop. I got a good JanSport Backpack for my niece a few month ago and she liked that one, so I chose JanSport again. It's out of question that JanSport is generally a good brand.But this particular backpack is really poorly made. The texture is made by some cheap materials, and definitely looks not as good as the picture shown on the website. There are not many compartments in the bag with poor paddings, and the space is not as big as that was described at all. Nevertheless, the laptop sleeve is too wide for my 15' widescreen notebook. So I bought another backpack of Swissgear this weekend when I saw it on sale with only one third price of this JanSport. And the quality of my new bag is Much Much Much BETTER than this one.Don't buy this backpack!	0
Having read all of Patricia Cornwell's books, I was very disappointed about her latest achievment. Draging the villain through 3 separate books probably wasn't her best idea. Even more disturbing: The characters of her main heros (Scarpetta, Marino, Lucie) were described inconsistent with her previous books	0
Romeo & Juliet is a romance novel. It's a story that will make your heart sink. This magnificent couple had such a strong love for each other. It was so strong that they died together. In the beginning it was crazy how they are enemies and they want to be together but it's hard to because what they are doing is wrong to their families. At the ending they died together with their love stronger than ever, it's a heartbreaking story, wishing that they would live happily ever after.I really enjoyed this story, although I do wish that they could have lived to be together and in love.	1
"AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH! I have never EVER been soooooooo BORED in all my life! I found myself talking out loud to my television screen, saying things like...""JUST BLOW YOUR BRAINS OUT ALREADY YOU KURT COBAIN WANNABE!

I decided to make the change to pampers based on all the positive reviews from customers. It was a bad decision for my baby! It gave my poor baby a really bad diaper rash from the chemical in the baby dry! Maybe good diapers for others, but definitely not for my baby. I will be sticking with Huggies!	0
I was very pleased to purchase this product at such a great price point. It is an excellent product. But even better, the product was delivered quickly and in perfect condition. I would go back to this vendor again.	1
"OK,listen up people! My daughter Lauren bought me this book for mothers day because of its cartoonish cover. But we all know the saying ""Don't judge a book by its cover!"" My daughter read it before me (let me mention shes ten and very mature)and liked it but when I read it we both agreed that it sort of overdid the sexual content, but is a good book none the less. It was funny, sad,outragious, and over all a sweet and amusing book. Mostly for adults but mature pre-teens can read it too! Wonderfulfor adults and kids who understand love and the situations in this book. And might I add that Lauren could not put it down for five seconds even if she tried! Same thing with me!Go buy it unless your BORING..."	1
Unlike other reviews here, for me the lapinator and mousepad didn't work so well. Used it with a Toshiba Satellite laptop and optical mouse. After about 2 hours, the lapinator was almost HOT to the touch, laptop fan did not run less, laptop itself did not feel cool to the touch. Had better luck with other coolant systems. Maybe Toshibas run hotter than other laptops, so it could be a matter of that particular laptop not being well-suited for the lapinator. I run my new HP Pavillion right on my desk's surface, with no resulting overwarming of the laptop or the desk surface. Possibly, this particular cooling pad works optimally with only certain laptops.	0

This CD is the bomb, it has something to do with sex but it works for me! My favorite songs out of it is: All I Really Want, I Wish and the remix, also the greatest sex along with I Decided. I believe this is R. Kelly's best album, all organised and all produced by him... I would like to give this album a million stars. I'm out, 1 love all.	1
"The book was alleged to be ""new"" but the cover showed considerable wear. I think it was probably read and then offered for sale as ""new""."	0
I was held completely enthralled through the first half of this book. i loved the setting and it's description. I loved the heroine and the 'wee lad' she took under her wing. My only problems with it were that, for me, there weren't enough love scenes, and they arrived too late in the story...and the fact the author decided to throw in another couple into the mix, without fully fleshing out their story. I think Ms. Garwood should have stuck to her main protagonists and left the other couple for another book	1
This product works great for the N64 if you need a cord with a coaxel to the back of your tv. Very hard to find locally. Wanted to play Goldeneye and Super Mario 64, as well as WWF No Mercy for nastalga purposes and let me tell ya, the picture quality was great. This is by far the best cord on the market. I had bought 2 from amazon because it was very hard to tell from the pictures if this had the cord to go where the cable cord goes in the back of the tv. It does and it works and functions great on my 55 inch HDTV. the other cord I bought didn't have the same picture quality. Thanks NyKo!!	1

This is a wonderful series that has great shows. Its a shame that the producers don't make them more often and are dragging out the process.	1
A Philadelphia Catholic in King James's Court was a good book. It taught me a lot about my faith that I didn't know. It also got into more detail about the things I already knew. This book is about a boy from Philadelphia named Michael O'Shea. After the death of his father, Michael and his family go to live with his Uncle Les, his mom's brother, in Kentucky for the summer. Down in Kentucky Michael is forced to defend his religion against his Uncle Les and church elders such as, Luther, George, and Jimmy. I enjoyed this book, but the only thing I disliked about it was that it was hard to get in to. The beginning was boring and wordy to me, but I finally got into the book during the Bible Studies. They were very interesting and knowledge filled. This was a very good book and a fast read, I would rate this book a 4 out of 5 stars.	1
"I bought this as a gift to my sister, but before I wrapped it, I ended up looking through the photos that told the haunting story of 9-11. Now, granted, I have not seen the other books by other publishers, but I was amazed at the vividness captured on film. My wife is a photographer, and I know how hard she works to capture images that are ""worth a 1,000 words."" The photographers who sold their images to Life have done their job. If you want a keep-sake to remember one of the greatest tragedies in American history, I recommend this book. It helps give perspective as to the true tragedy of the events taking place that day."	1

"I don't think the author's comment is referring this model because this rice cooker does not use the floating ball mechanism in its valve. I have the same experience as T. Panar ""belldandi"" on using the rice cooker. Cleaning is very easy. And it works very well on different type of rice."	1
I bought this book hoping it could help me understand shakespeare's words better, but it didnt. Instead I had to look up every other word in a dictionary or sometimes even online. Soon it just got so hectic that i just threw the book out and bought a better more reliable source.	0
How nice. Tess is a totally unrealistic character-she has more sorrow in her life then most of us have in a century. This book is extremely sad, and I don't understand why it's a classic. Tess is very happy until her alchoholic dad discovers that they were a noble family, so, getting to big for his britches, he sends Tess over to another D'urberville family, which actually just adopted the name because they wanted to seem influential. That's when the trouble starts. Soon, Tess gives birth to a baby, and goes back home in disgrace. Then she meets another nice guy, who abandons her when he learns of her past. They author could have done with some happpy scenes...life's not all sadness!	0
The new SWEATSUIT album is hot. My favorite song is Tired featuring Avery Storm. I can really relate to this song. Sometime you get too feed up and you can't take it anymore. That's when its time to go. My man Nelly really did it this time. I have to give him mad props. I LOVE this man. I cannot wait for more to come. Keep up the good work Nelly.	1
I have only read 2 of her books first I read Ransom and I just finished The Secret I would never suggest you to read it in that order read The Secret first and then read Ransom YOu will fall in love with the characters so quickly. Julie Garwood is so good at adding humor and romance and drama into her novels. These two novels compliment each other and once you pick these books up they are hard to put down. I promise that they are a great buy.	1

Not only does Loretta invite Ronny to the wedding, she falls in love with him. Her close-knit Italian family offers her their insights on love and life. Cher and Olympia Dukakis glow in their Oscar award-winning performances.	1
I absolutely love the kit, it should have come with some more micro fiber cloths and the wax did spill when i received the box but besides that it works well. For painted rims i would definitely tell you not to use the tyre and rim cleaner as it's pretty strong.	1
The product states that inches will be removed after 30 days of use and I have worn this item everyday for at least 12 hrs per day and I have not seen any kind of difference.For the price of the item, it is disappointing when it advertises and does not comply.	0
I checked this book out of the library after reading rave review after rave review.I wanted to like it, I really did, but I honestly cannot understand all the high marks. To me the book reads as if it were written by a 6th-grader. Characterization and storyline aside, the language itself is what turned me off. It seemed stilted, contrived, lacking in fluidity, and devoid of any real color; an amateurish effort at best.Perhaps this reads better in its native tongue, but the translation I read was atrocious. I promptly returned it to the library, shooting it soundly down the return bin with a force that it so richly deserved.	0
This is perhaps the most thought provoking book I have ever read. Unfortunately, I missed this book in my earlier days of public education, but I have found a real treasure now. This book is very topical in the policitically-correct world in which we live. I find it hard to believe that so many of the fears that are expressed in Beatty's speech to Montag regarding why books or ideas were burned have come to fruition. In fact, the most stirring part of this edition is the coda where Bradbury's ideas about censorship are expressed in first-person. A must read for any would-be scholar.	1
wow this cd is so heavy and brutal , the guys from cannibal corpse and slayer had to retire. i mean the lyrics are so insane the riffs so intenseafer listening to this im afraid to listen to it again cuz its so heavy!!!pantera slayer and cannibal corpse sucsk!	0
everyone MUST go out and buy this wonderful cd by super star Clay Aiken!! it will leave you breathless and wanting more!! don't delay, it will sell out fast!!!	1
Why does this series need to be so much more expensive than most of the other TV shows? Especially considering these don't even have the original soundtrack. The first thing I think of when I think about My Three Sons is the great music that went along with the show, and it's missing from this way over-priced version. As much as I love My Three Sons, I will wait for the original version to be released at a reasonable price before I buy.	0
Even at the incredible Friday sale price of $4.99, I would not recommend these flannel sheets for purchase because of the very poor sewing workmanship. The stitches were very large, and also some of the edges were simply turned over once and sewn with a raw (easy to unravel) edge. The sheet would not hold up well after the first washing. I resewed all the edges of both sheets.	0
Buy this at a discount price, it's not something you want to buy for $14.00 at a music store.	0
This is a light weight film with a heavy weight star. The film is not worthy of the great Paul Muni.	0
My son was in need of a sturdy bookbag. Rather than buy another inexpensive one that would surely fall apart, I sought out something more durable. I saw this JanSport bag in a local store and thought it was perfect! It was roomy enough for all his books, was well-made with strong and sturdy fabric and had awesome cushioned straps! Problem was, it was more than I was looking to spend.I did an online search and was amazed to find the very same bag on Amazon for less than half the price! I jumped on it. The backpack arrived within days and my son LOVED it. He claims it's so much more comfortable to carry his books now.Again, an awesome product at a rock-bottom price! Thanks Amazon.	1
"There are maybe 3 good movies in the bunch and seperately they are inexpensive movies. The rest are bad writing, directing, acting, etc. Several are ""foreign"" films I guess because the accents are so thick that the dialogue cannot be understood. I will usually sit through any movie at least once, some of these were so bad I shut them off before I finished watching them. If there are any you recognize that you don't own and are building a library, worth the price; but if you think you are getting 8 great movies at a low price, think again.DLP"	0
"As a Chicagoan, I am so proud to boast about Ralph's World. These songs are witty, catchy and have great messages. My one year old daughter just loves listening to them in the car. When Tra La La comes on, she starts singing ""la la la."" My husband cracks up at the song about the eighteen wheeler every time. The only track we don't like it is Harry's Haunted Halloween Circus, but it is easily skipped."	1
"Cet album est chant√© vraiment bien. Jean-Jacques et les autres ""types"" ont bien fait! Les chansons sont pas forte en vocales, mais les paroles sont tr√®s tr√®s √©mouvantes.

Ten year old Erna Anderson and her sixteen year old sister Alfreda lived lives of poverty in Sweden. Their father went to America seven years ago, and finaly sent for Mother and their little brother Karl. But Karl had died, and Mother was ill, so Erna and Alfreda would have to make the journey to America alone, in third class on the Titanic. The two sisters, seperated at first by poverty and sorrow, soon become friends. But when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, can they survive?	1
This affectionate and humorous screenplay moves so quickly it may convert me to reading fewer novels, more screenplays. It is also a beautifully motivated piece and, in my opinion, Gompertz's best writing to date. What a lovely seasonal gift this will make--for yourself or a friend.----Reviewed by Carolyn Howard-Johnson, awardj-winning author of THIS IS THE PLACE, HARKENING and THE FRUGAL BOOK PROMOTER: HOW TO DO WHAT YOUR PUBLISHER WON'T, the winner of USA Book News Best Book of 2004, Professional Books Category.	1
After I watched this film I was ready to watch it again. This is a fantastic movie; if you love a great action packed film with a beautiful scenery and a wonderful story of courage, friendship and love. You will enjoy this film. With a love of history in it's truest form. Don't listen to the critics they never know what they are talking about I somtimes wonder if they even watch the films they talk about. Watch this film you will enjoy every sec. of it.	1
This game was very fun, but it had some flaws. For instance, when in the Mines of Moria, the game will freeze at a certain point. It was very frustrating, but it is a common problem and can be worked around by going to the customer service website.The game ends suddenly when Boromir tries to take the ring from Frodo. It is very annoying having to wait for the next game before you can continue the quest!Other than that, the game is very fun & challenging. It is especially good for long car trips!	1
I love this table it is solid, heavy,and sturdy. EASY to assemble took me 10 to 20 minutes. I posted the pictures above. The table was well packed, so what more can I say everything was just perfect!!	1
This Reunion of two superstars is long overdue in CD form. Every one of the 24 songs is enjoyable. My own favorite is The Moon is a Harsh Mistress. I'm not a big country music fan, but this album should appeal to a wide range of listeners. I've been a Jimmy Webb fan since his work with the 5th Dimension and Richard Harris. His writing is the best, and Glen Campbell's voice has never sounded better. I ordered the CD based on the pre-release mention on the VH-1 special on Glen Campbell and have played it daily since it arrived. It's a real pleasure to hear this great work.	1
I loved this book the first time I read it, and when I first picked it up I had trouble putting it down. I was fourteen when I first read it, so I would recomend it to people in that age group. However, there isn't much deeper meaning to the book. If you're looking for a fun, easy, dramtic book, this is perfect.	1
This is really a bad product. I bought it in hope that I could have one extra bedding when required. I used it on first night for myself and after 3-4 it deflated, annoyingly i filled the air back in night and went to sleep. In morning i was awake again because it has deflated. I thought i am doing something wrong, read the manual and searched online, found nothing. Next night it was the same story. Returned to amazon.(note: this was not my first product either, earlier I tried their queen bedding and it was similar story too)STAY AWAY FROM THIS PRODUCT will be my advice.	0
This item is not meant for children to play with! Strange, since it has to do with action figures of Super Heroes! But honestly, if your child does more than set this on a shelf, you'll soon be hearing screams of frustration. The elevator won't work! (ours completely stopped working in 2 days); The guns on the top keep falling off!; The whole thing just falls apart. No, this item is for the collector and I think Mattel KNEW that. They figured the few that were opened and did not work offset all the ones that would remain MIB or NRFB for collectors.This item is just like Mattel's HOT WHEELS JUNKIE SETS. Another sore point with parents. Hot Wheels cars are fine, but those sets that Mattel makes NEVER work as promised. And what's with the instructions that have little to no writing on them??! Some of the drawings are impossible to figure out. In Mattel's case, a word is worth a thousand illustrations!	0
From the keyboard intro to Pleasure Palace all the way to the end of Jealous Heart, this album never fails to deliver. There are no filler tracks, every song is a 110% example of what a classic rock song should sound like. Where are they now..........	1
Thomas Paine strikes a (still) powerful blow for Jeffersonian values and deism. In my mind, definitely a classic.	1
Seriously, I am quite the fantasy reader. However, this piece of dribble should not have ever been published. It is one of the WORST books I have ever read- in any genre. No plot or charecter development, nothing. If you want good fantasy, go read one of the DRAGONLANCE titles.	0
This book is a fascinating exploration of the last days of the Soviet Union, providing a background of the broad mix of events and people involved both before, during and after the Gorbachev era. It maps the mindset and events during this dramatic change. It is told with a direct, personal style that I found gripping, and that gives a very good sense of the societal changes and impacts. I highly recommend it.	1

The Winter Solstice (as with the solstices and equinoxes) hold a special place in our world because anyone can celebrate them. So many cultures and religions have customs, beliefs, rituals that occur on or around the Solstice.This book highlights some well known and not so well know European Solstice and Yule customs. It also delves quite a bit into Christmas customs that were influenced by eariler Pagan ones. But the information in this book is extended outside the Euro realm and reaches many cultures - really emphasising a common bond between all people.The book is nice enough to offer as a gift or a coffetable treasure. It has a wonderful layout and lots of beautiful pictures, drawings, and poems. In the back of the book it has a couple of Rituals/ Plays that are suitable for public Ritual or a seasonal play.This book can be enjoyed by anyone but definitely appeals to Pagans or curious/ liberal Christians.	1
The subject matter is very interesting and the research was obviously thorough but reading it is another matter. I am afraid I just couldn't keep making myself plow through it. It surprises me that this was the Oregon Reads selection. You would have to be a truly determined reader already to get through the endless detail and absence of warmth or color in the writing.	0
Great boots. Never had better. Hold up well and definitely keep the water out. Nice and warm in the New England winters. Highly recommend these boots.	1
I love love love this rice cooker. It was finally time that I got a decent cooker. Don't bother buying a cheap rice cooker. It is a waste of money and they really can't compare to using a machine like this.	1
Why do books such as this keep being required reading in high schools? Havent there been any authors in more recent time that would provide students more relevancy? Obviously this appeals to those who are truly literature lovers--and that's fantastic. But for most kids, give them something they'll enjoy reading and maybe they'll learn to love literature more. Books like this just antagonize and demoralize those who are not naturally literature lovers.	0
I bought this for my daughter to sleep on when she was home from college. She actually liked sleeping on it but 3 weeks later it developed a slow leak which I could not find. Therefore I had to throw it away. A complete waste of money.	0
The DVD was unwatchable the sound was intermittent.Positively the worst purchase I have ever made on AmazonI suspect the DVD was a Pirate copy	0
This book isn`t worth the paper it is written on!!It contained nothing of substance.Where did this couple live?What were their last names?What was a day like at home for the mother(Hyacynth)?What were her children like?What was important to her?These are just a few of the subjects not even touched upon by the author.I couldn`t get past the first 100 pages.I hav not read any of this authors other books since Evergreen,which I loved.This book was a waste of my time and money.I will not ever waste anymore money on this authors books.	0
Purchased online, good description with size included. However, when it arrived it was larger than advertised (length and circumference). It was actually to large and caused some discomfort. It has a very hard plasltic like feeling which did not help with insertion. It seems to be well built if you are looking for the terminator of vibrators!! If you have had a few kids and need something bigger and harded, this is for you! For us it was a waste of the money spent as we will not be using it again.	0
I am ready to throw this one out the window. I just inherited it upon marriage and now I know why the daughter who owned it wanted her own things when she moved out.I am really tired of Out of Paper and Pater Jam notices.I consider myself to be extremely printer competent but this machine has not little tricks for coaxing it to print. It is just junk.	0
"This DVD is a compilation of short excerpts from Christmas themed Veggietales videos. Some of the ""songs"" aren't even complete songs, just a portion of another video that has singing. A lot of cutting and pasting different scenes together to make a ""complete"" song. Not sure how 30 seconds of a musical number can be called a song. Portions seem to simply cut off in mid sentence. There are no traditional Christmas songs so its only a ""sing-a-long"" if your kids are familiar with the previously released Veggietales Christmas videos. My daughter loves the traditional Veggietales videos but lost interest in this within minutes. The very end of the DVD has 3 traditional Christmas songs that simply play the music and scroll the words across the screen karaoke style with a still background. Disappointed in this product from Veggietales."	0
Blues Saraceno is nothing short of a demi-god when it comes to musical genius. His approach to music in it's entirety is amazing to say the least. He has replaced my past favorites and now stands proud at the top. While he is fast as Vai and Satriani, his phrasing is majestic. His tone in unprecedented and unmatchable. Surprising to say, Saraceno cut all of these tracks in his own home studio at the ages of 16-23. You will understanding what I am talking about when you hear this albumn. BUY THIS CD!!! REVEL IN ITS BEAUTY!!! SPREAD THE WORD OF BLUES SARACENO!!!	1
I have been using Pampers since my baby was born. They are perfect. I loved the product and i suggest to every mother and father.	1
At first we tried Pampers swaddlers, and they were great except that my baby developed a diaper rash when using them. We switched to Baby Dry, and the rash went away. However, they consistantly leaked whenever he was on his side while nursing. About 10 times I have ended up with a wet lap.Also, they do not fit very well, as they have no stretch around the waist. We switched to Huggies and they are wonderful. They haven't ever leaked and they stretch around the legs and waist.	0
No greater recommendation can be made than to note that the intrepid and honorable Horatio Hornblower is given as one of the great influences in the life of that other most-famous fictional Captain, one James Tiberius Kirk.	1
I purchased this as a gift for my grandson's 2nd birthday, knowing that his 4year old brother would be playing with it just as much, so needed something that was big enough to share without causing conflict. The main reason for this particular type of pop-up tent was just that, it pops up. We've had the ones with the poles before and they are such a nuisance to assemble and take apart. These 5 pieces went up in about 8 minutes and were taken down in about 5, you cannot ask more than that. We'll have to see how long they all last, but so far, both boys are having a great time sinking basketballs and pretending whatever it is they pretend. If it lasts just the one season, I'll be happy, everything else is gravy.	1
The message is clear.Burn the words to cover-up and control society through censorship -vs- the fire for warmth, and light for learning. Let the people make up their own minds as to which helps or hinders them.Truth, actually keeps a society in a better position (no-matter how much it seems to hurt in the present) than any ideal forward pushing utopian lies...It is a great book, and Ray's real purpose/philosophy point blankly shines in the later chapters.Thats my broadbrushstroked opinion. Amazon does not offer fine lines concerning gold stars. If they did, I would rate it 4.625	1
Some books you read you enjoy and forget and then there are books that stick with you for the rest of your life. I can honestly say this is probably one of the most important books written in human history. One of the reasons is that it is an almost recognizably real dystopian world eerily close to the one we live in. This book is a stark warning of what we could become; what unchecked government erosion of liberty can eventually lead to.If you read this, you'll read the news in a different way.In the end, you'll love Big Brother.	1
First time buying a toy of this type. Great orgazm but then the buttons stopped working and the devise would not increase in speed or intensity and nor wood it shut off. No wat to return it on Amazon due to policy	0
This book is not very helpful! It needs better examples and more info. I was disapointed, would not reccomend getting this book	0
This movie is funny and, often times, ridiculous (as most Adam Sandler movies tend to be). However, it's also incredibly sweet and makes me tear up (yes, I'll admit it) every single time I watch it. I absolutely adore this movie.	1
I read this in high school and loved it. I'm reading it to my children now (the oldest is 7yrs) and they love it also. I think they would get more out of it in a year or two, but this is a must read! There is a reason it won an award!	1
"""A World Within a World"" says it all. This is probably the best CD I own. I absolutly LOVE silverchair, I have been a fan since they first came out with ""Tomorrow"". This CD just proves how diverse and talented they are. Daniel Johns (lead singer) has such a beautiful and magestic voice.It definitely makes all troubles go away by just listening to it. It is soooo great to hear these bright and happy lyrics. I am looking forward to hearing much more from them."	1
I bought this as a gift for a friend who has a 70# lab-shar-pei mix. Even though this dog's head is a bit smaller than the one pictured on the front of the product, it fit perfectly and my friend has seen great results in her walks with her dog, who used to pull like mad, but is now behaving really well thanks to this little contraption.	1
"I got it at the library and boy am I glad I didn't waste my money by buying it, which I might have done based on Donati's first novel. I am sooo disappointed! This was a snoozorama to say the least. I guess I can only hope for improvement in the 3rd novel. This novel was just sooooooo slow and boring, Daniel and ""Boots"" had no chemistry which was very disappointing"	0
Probably ostaras best release to date. Containing elements of neo folk,goth rock,post punk and and numerous other elements..ostara stand apart from most neo folk acts in the vocals..much more poppy and happy sounding. The whole cd has a warm, inviting sound that demand heavy rotation.	1
"Enough has been said about this movie already, I think, considering its overall flimsiness. It really is ""ironic"" fun, as someone mentioned, and only for those who are tolerant enough to handle a bit of fluff and not have a coronary about it. I thought it was pretty amusing. It helps if you're into sailing and sunny ports. Be that as it may, I am surprised that no one has commented on the ""theme"" song. It features quite prominently in the beginning, introducing us to the two English lasses whiling away their evenings singing badly in a sleazy Gibraltar sailor dive; and towards the end of the film, it introduces the final twist... with a vengeance. As it turned out to my delight, ""You're leaving me"" -- the title of aforementioned ditty -- was an almost direct translation of a song called ""Porque te vas"" by Jose Luis Perales, one of my favorite Spanish singer-songwriters. Great song, really! Silly performance, though. I'm almost a bit curious what JLP got out of it..."	1
I have been a huge Adam Sandler fan for years. I love this movie it makes me laugh so hard. I would recommend it to anyone who wants a change from the same old same old holiday movies. Two thumbs up:))	1
This is one of my favorite movies of all time. I could not believe the price I picked this CD up for - very reasonable.	1
it was fun educational in side is a whole new world where you learn to spend save and shop and I gave it to my sister and she loved it you can also go online at neopets.com and if you have a neopet accont you get a rare virtule item.	1
I was hoping to introduce my teens to Jules Verne while traveling; so, I ordered the audio cassettes. However, on most of the tapes, the volume would suddenly go down to be almost inaudible. The quality of two of the cassettes was so bad that only about 1/4 of the tape could be understood.	0
These were cheap and effective, they sound great considering that they are driven by a the original OEM radio/deck. Other speakers for the same price don't compare, and were returned, they can't hold up the bass parts as well as these.	1
This band absolutely sucks. All their songs sound the same the lead singer can't sing and he wants to be like the lead singer from Godsmack, but at least Godsmack makes a good sound. System of a Down makes a putrid sound and everytime I hear their song I want to puke.	0
"This is one of Verne's best books. It is full of scientific and technical/technological details (I had to use several encyclopedias/dictionaries to find some words' meaning), historical references - no doubt Verne researched the topics thoroughly. It is also humorous in places but certainly entertaining and serious on every page. As the story progresses you will discover Verne's view on society in sentences like ""The world needs no new continents, it needs new people."" As for the storyline, you will never guess what happens next. Every intelligent person with an open mind will find this book a must read."	1
"This story felt like I was living there...feeling, tasting, sweating, right along with the characters. I would have sworn Gloss was taking this word for word from the woman's diary. Being thrilled by such everyday struggles like getting a mule down the hill..now thats what I call virtual reality. I was so enthralled by the ""cowboys""...kept thinking I never would have dreamed I'de love a book like this so much...but it was so true and delicious. Thanks for taking me to Oregon in the 1890's. It was a thrilling, amazing adventure. The struggle's the pioneers endured were incredible...so much more so for a woman, and a woman alone at that!"	1
I've got all of the Smaville seasons and have enjoyed them all. I'm disappointed that the show is ending. I like the characters and the plots.	1
I downloaded the free sample--there were NO illustrations! The text was not long & boring as other reviewers have said; Is the sample a bad representation?	0
Some of the other reviews are correct, this is a great Elton John record. But I didnt buy it to listen to Elton John, I bought it to get the music from the movie.I am very disappointed. While Elton John is indeed a good artist, that is not why I wanted this. The makers of this cd have cheated me and anyone else who is a fan of the movie. They have set this up as a soundtrack to get your money, but instead it is nothing more than an Elton John music.Which is why it only gets 1 star from me.	0
"I bought this cd immediately because I watched some of AI2 and was mesmerized by Clay Aiken's voice. Truthfully, I didn't expect much at first, as it seemed to be a hurriedly put out album. (I expected it to be cover after cover.) But, the first time I listened to MOAM, I was impressed! To those who criticise the lack of ""edginess"", you can get all the ""edginess"" you can bear from some of the rest of those ""artists"" out there....So going on two months later, where is that cd? In my home, my car, my husband's car....you get the picture. Clay should win a grammy for this cd!"	1
Arrived safe and sound and in a timely manner. Nice addition to my ever-growing classic movie library!	1
i had to read this for my college english class. i'm not much of a reader of the classics, but i was surprised by how much i like this book. an incredible use of satire and wit.although, i will say, i know i wouldn't have gotten as much out of it if it wasn't for the class i was taking. i still found the story and voltaire's implications quite enjoyable.	1
Nothing to to say about it thank u didn't enjoy it so why say something why rate it a waste of money	0
The cover was the best photo found in the book. Many pictures showed busy rooms and cluttered kitchens. I love country chic style and am a HUGE fan of cath kidson and rachel ashwell as well as other books such as New Cottage Style and Country Chic. If you are looking for those styles, this is NOT the book. After looking through this book, i wanted to clean out my entire house due to the clutter overload.	0
A little too flowery for my taste and not very scientific. Then again what did I expect !!! Easy pros however if you want to learn about anatomy, get an anatomy atlas !!	0
I have read all the reviews, but did not write until I read Jaan's review. All I can say to the so called music critics and Jaan, GET OVER IT, Clay is here to stay. It was very obvious from Jaan's review that he/she is a fan of ?????? and someone wants to hurt sales of Clay's upcoming new release.Measure of a Man is wonderful because you can actually understand the words and the range of Clay's voice is incredible. I agree with other reviewers that MOAM gets better the more you listen to it.Clay is a powerful singer as shown in the duet with Ruben on the AMA's. They were the only singers to get a standing ovation from their peers.My favorites are I survived you, and Touch	1
This is the cd you definately shouldn't purchase! This cd is only a copy of the best-seller 'das boot' from the movie. the only new about this song is the singing from the female part of the group, and some new samples, everything else is just a copy.the song is supposed to get u 96 back on the map again, but they are only falling between two chairs with this one. stay away from this one!I am a fan of the group and I was truly disappointed about the total-concept.	0
I would stay up til 1:00 am on school nights reading this book! The charactors were intresting, and sounded like people I would love to meet! When Kit helped Hannah escape I was amazed that she did that! When Mathew stood up for Kit I could tell that he realy did love her even though he never realy showed it. The whole story was good! I liked the way Kit amazed the people on the boat when she jumped over board to get the little girl's doll. I think beginning, middle, and end were all well done. I would recomend this book to every one! I consider this one of the best books of the centry	1
I was warned by many that this is a one star movie at best. Silly me I had to see for may self. If there is someone you do not like then you can recommend this movie to them.Not that the premise is bad enough, that of Nazis surviving in the underworld but the film itself had cheep graphics and stilted dialog. The actors looked like porn star rejects. They did not even try to be campy. The gory parts were pathetic and anatomically incorrect.Do not let your fast forward button over heat.I am going to cut the review short before I barf.	0
I love this rice cooker, it lets me eat rice whenever I want, with its timer settings. Not only that, it has appropriate cooking settings - perfect for any kind of rice cooking. I personally like semi-brown rice, so I just put rice in, set the timer for 7am night before, then eat the rice all day for all my meals.I also saw this rice cooker at 99 Ranch market for 120 dollars so maybe it's a better deal than Amazon. I got 25 off for this from amazon but if you can get to 99 ranch, get it there instead if you can find it.	1
"This is truly a timeless book. Great for young or old. The illustrations are beautiful and at this price you won't be disappointed. My wife and I shared this book with our granddaughter and she would ask us over and over ""let's read Ratty and Mole"". We are so happy to be able to find this edition again and share it with our great-grandchildren."	1
Kit Tyler has to leave her beloved Barbados. She leaves to live with her aunt and uncle. She wonders if she'll ever fit in. Meeting the lady by blackbird pond whom everyone believes is a witch makes her feel better about herself, and visits her as often as possible.But soon she puts another in danger. Could this put her in danger as well?I would highly recommend this book. This thrilling novel makes you want to read it all at once. Full of action,love and some rebellion, not only has it won a Newberry Medal but also it captivates the imagination.	1
I have never seen a book quite like this, although I have come across self-help books or instructional guides which try to help with some simple guidelines. This book on the other hand gives complete and numerous examples and practical methods to achieve the goals given (Note: the section on working with the AIDS Patients.) As if all the other books were afraid to open up..........or perhaps they just didn't have much to say. This wonderful guide lets it rain down.....and when it rains, it pours.	1
"I was disappointed with this book. I expected ""real"" ghost stories with substance. The book only has short folklore legends."	0
The product title is incorrect. This card is 10MB/s (up to 66x). That is what it actually says on the box, not 133x. It isn't a problem for me because 66x is plenty fast for my panasonic fx30 camera. But if you really require 133x (i.e. 20MB/s) this is not the card for you.	1
looks like master p and silkk should consider retiring once again. no limit's best days are way behind them.	0
Others have mentioned the heroine is a brat, and she truly is. I'm half-way through and dislike her immensely. Shouldn't I like her by page 156, and be rooting for her and the gorgeous hero? I feel bad that Quin is going to end up with this awful woman. This isn't the worst book I've ever read, but there are so many better ones! The plot sounded fun to me and Quin isn't an alpha male, but still likeable enough. Its Maddie. She slaps him. She makes fun of him. She has atrocious manners. She's insufferable!	0
"After reading Jon Krakauer's book, I had to have more! Unfortunately, I choose Ruth Ann Kocour's book, which reads like an account of a life-threatening adventure as told by an adolescent. Although she is not a journalist, her recounting of conversations do not ring true and all the ""voices"" sound alike. And while I appreciated some insight into how bodily functions are handled on the mountain, a more mature attitude would have gone a long way."	0
This book needs a grammar check. It is incomprehensible. I am trying to return it. It sucks, to coin a pun.	0
The other reviewers owe me the price of this book. They are either very gullible or relatives of the author.Thoughts have frequencies and travel faster than light.Need I say more?	0
As others have pointed out, this version is missing critical portions that totally ruin one of the greatest mysteries in the English language. Free is generally good, but not in this case.	0
"I'm sorry but Ray J can't sing worth a damn. Everytime ""One Wish"" comes on the radio I have to change the station - it's too painful to listen to. I can't believe they let that one get past the studio...please make it stop!!"	0
This CD proves without any doubt why Clay has his popularity. He is an amazing singer and true entertainer. People may be jealous, dazed and confused but Clay is a winner no matter what you people may say. Hell, Clay has gone triple platinum. Can Ruben say that, I think NOT! Ha! Ha! Who did you get your info. from. Jealous Mother Fu*kers trying to have you cake and eat it too.	1
"I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, ""leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to"". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier."	0
"Do you not remember the Clan of the Cave Bear hype in the mid-80's.....it was all the rage. The book is good. Good story, a little difficult to believe at times, since a lot of the actions of the people in the ""clans"" are hypothesized. But all in all a determinate story of survival, and coming of age in the post ice valleys. I do believe that she, Auel stole a bit from the Native Americans, well not steal per se, since their culture more closely mirrors the nomadic clans, but there are interesting depictions of seers, spirit chasers and medicine women. There are some romantic scenes which I have to admit were a little much for a 14 year old, but interesting nonetheless. Slightly educational and a good read. - Jennifer Rees"	1
I like the Mr Coffee cup warmer in most respects. However, a couple of features that are sorely missing and I am surprised that this product can be marketed without them.There is no auto shutoff switch. I have had other cup warmers in the past that would shutoff after an hour. They also had a sensor that would shut off if no cup was present.I have left my cup warmer on with no cup sitting there a burning all night when I was sleeping. How much more would it cost to add these important safety and energy conservation capabilities.I would gladly pay the difference.	0
This short book contains the story of Humberto Alexander's 22 years in Castro's prisons. It is a story of courage and faith under the ugliest of conditions. Alexander was shot, tortured repeatedly, starved, and treated in the most unspeakably inhuman ways, yet through it all his faith in Christ allows him and his fellow prisoners to survive and even to love those who were torturing them. You will not regret reading this book!	1
have always loved the movie, finally decided to purchase it was glad i found it at amazon for really cheap! :) including shipping i only paid $3!! thanks amazon!	1
The book unfortunately doesn't have line numbers next to them. Now I'm not sure if this is a bug on my kindle, or if it goes for everybody who has this book, but line numbers aren't there. I need to read this book for school and it would help if there are line numbers for reference. Other than that it is a pretty good book!	1
Tubthumping was Rad! But the rest of the cd doesnt stand a chance of being a hit, the rest is just terrible. I didnt expect any of the other tracks to be singles, and they havent, though they do have a sophmore album.	0
I would like to think that I am always supportive of Australian talent, but in this case I am not. This book is highly impractical in the main. I mean really, who could devote 7 days to working on a magickal new self. It's a lovely idea, but just so self-centred. The amount of money you would have to spend to fossick around for all the bits and pieces she says you need, urgh you'd need a lie down after that. Ok so she sort of redeems herself at the end with a small section on what to do if you don't have the time, but it's a token chapter.The other thing is that most of the text appears to have been borrowed form her other publications, and the picture on the front, whilst very cutesy, she is a pretty lass after all, is a real-turn off to a serious Wiccan practitioner.Sorry Fiona, not a great buy or unique read.	0
I just can't get past the leads fake British accent! the brown hair is not a good or believable look for her either. they should have used an unknown. over all bad acting by the whole cast too!	0
Jennifer Love Hewitt did a not-too-bad job in portraying Audrey Hepburn although she was not able to grasp everything about Audrey. Speaking the truth, playing Audrey Hepburn is a gambling, a risky task in every sense. I don't think that there r more than very few ppl who can really carry the mission, and we can't expect that we are going to see a facsimile of the best actress in the Hollywood history. So, at least, we should give Jennifer some applauses for her courage to take the role.	1
"Loaded with workout tips and guides (even if you think you know it all). Focuses on working out and not on the normal crud that fills the others - if I wanna know ""10 pickup lines that work 90% of the time, every time"" then I can pickup one of those other magazines that by the title you'd think would be focusing on working out, but is filled with fluff!"	1
The packaging was coming off the back of the package and the box it was in was distorted. I wanted to give this as a christmas present but it doesn't even look new!	0
"I bought this since the big MK I also use was too heavy and messy to take into condos. I rehab ocean condos and lug all my tools into the condo for 2-3 months (compressor, table saw, router table, etc). So I focus on portability first.However, the instructions were limited, the arbor allows the blade to not spin true, and the setup screws will be quickly lost after unpacking.But strangely - the saw and fence quickly cut straight after you allow for the width of the blade wobble. Angles require some extra work. I used a 7"" speed square against the fence for diagonal cuts. I haven't tried the 1.3"" cutting depth yet. It should do it. But for how long? I don't see it as a long term contractor grade saw but as a saw that can be used for 2-3 yrs with about 2-3 jobs per year."	1
I would have to to even come close to what I feel is the best CD out this year. It's not filled with foul language, sexual innuendos, and you can actually understand the lyrics!!! What a concept!!! Clay's voice and emotion come through crystal clear on each and every track. While I've been a Clay fan since his Atlanta audition, I know people who weren't and they have listened to the CD and are now convinced. No matter what perception you may have about Clay, the man can sing!	1
"I guess I didn't find this CD memorable, as I couldn't even remember what it sounded like. There were no particular pieces that jumped out at me and cried ""Dance to me."" Overall I was not that impressed."	0
"Simply a Masterpiece album, THE BEST ALBUM EVER MADE, MY FAVORITE ALBUM OF ALL TIME. R.KELLY IS A MUSICAL GENIUS. HE PUTS ALL HIS HEART AND SOUL ON THIS CLASSIC. All the 19 songs are perfect blazing hot. But, my most heard are: Strip for You, Greatest Sex, I Don`t Mean It, Just Like That, Like a Real Freak, Don`t You Say No, ONE ME, I WISH & HIS REMIX, A WOMAN`S THREAT, I DECIDED, All I Really Want, FEELIN ON YO BOOTY AND THE STORM IS OVER NOW. As I said ALL ARE GEMS,ALMOST EVERY SONG COULD EASYLY BE A HIT SINGLE FO` SURE.BUY IT NOW. GET 3,4,5...COPIES IS WELL WORTH THE MONEY THAT COST. REMEMBER ALSO TO GET ""THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY"" ALBUM, I HEARD THAT IT WILL BE MAYBE THE ALBUM OF THE YEAR."	1
"I loved this video! Having bought multiple copies of the album, cassette, and finally CD (which doesn't wear out!), it should be obvious that I'm ecstatic about the music. Now, I've added this wonderful inside look to my collection. If you're a Fleetwood Mac ""Rumours"" fan, this is the best gift you could receive from someone! Every Fleetwood Mac fan will love this on their shelf to replay at will. Phenomenal!"	1
"If you are looking for a tape to dance ""with"", this isn't it.It's more like a documentary on dance."	0
Great CD. Glad I learned about this band. They do a GREAT cover of Super Mario Brothers. This is a new twist to Jazz.	1
"While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."	0
One of my favorite films of all time--and I'm not even religious. Poitier (plus entire cast) just about perfect here. Ralph Nelson, the director, did a wonderful job.No violance or nudity or profanity in this movie (not that I have anything against violence or profanity or skin in my movies) and yet it still ranks as one of the best movies I've ever seen...Goes to show you: you don't always have to have a bunch of car crashes and people being blown away every five minutes to end up with not only a successful/heartwarming picture on your hands, but one that continues to be popular more than thirty years after it was made.People who like this film might also want to check out Akira Kurosawa's Ikiru.	1
This mini-series is a taut thriller that I recommend to anyone. It's no surprise that an American version is in the works. It is well written, the charcters are real, the choice of actors is perfect, and none of the dialogue is gratuitous. Very compelling TV.	1
When Reich wrote this book in the early 50's He was supposed to have gone mad. After a first read of the book, you will find He was unusually lucid, much more than Nietzsche himself in the account of a Life ruling principle.Do not be afraid of any comment. Just enjoy reading it!	1
"Simon Fuller has done it again, taken an average mediocre-talent and turned them into a media-made powerhouse of hometown glory and over-promoted love ballads. As with former Idol stars Kelly Clarkson (who was the runner-up and ironically had a better selling album) and Justin Guarini, Aiken's album is filled with a rare uptempo ballad, a medium tempo moody ballads and crooning slow colorless ballads. Even his linear notes are all-too-predictable, thanking his family and God -- sure to make any middle-aged housewife or grandma swoon.Overall, Aiken's ""Measure of a Man"" undeniably shows an aspiring talent at work (there is no denying his voice), but the lack of creative inspiration or even -anything- out of the box perhaps shows that Aiken hasn't actually measured up to the man he could be quite yet.If you're an aging house-wife or a grandparent you'll absolutely love this CD, but if you have any musical taste whatsoever you'll avoid it completely."	0
My 15 year old son couldn't wait for me to get home so he did it by himself and he did a great job. He mechanically inclined so he felt good when it was done.	1
Just stick to rock. No experimentation please. That's not what Queen's music is about. Queen, Zeppelin, The Doors, Jethrotull...the ROCK man. Party on bud, but no funk.	0
Man Kzin Wars IX has four stories. The lead story by Poul Anderson is OLD, a repeat from another in the series. However, neither the Amazon entry nor the book itself make note of this; the publisher's dishonesty here is a real shame. The other three stories vary in quality, but at least two are good enough for this to be worthwhile in paperback next year.The one star rating reflects my poor opinion of repeated material with no warning. It probably would rate 3 stars otherwise. BTW, I am an old Niven fan, have read all his SF multiple times, and have read all of the Man-Kzin series.Amazon's automated machinery, or a hurried employee, has mixed in a bunch of reviews here that apply to other books in the series. It's too bad, but I've seem them mix up numbered series before. (See World Radio TV Handbook which is an annual series; they were selling the 2000 edition at a small discount to those who bought the 2002 edition!)	0
Big disappointment. I saw Brokaw on the talk shows and had high hopes for The Greatest Generation. But the author's dry, uninspired writing style made reading more chore than pleasure. I soon found myself skimming. I can recall only a few of the chapters. As a more readable subsitute, I recommend the similar book by Studs Turkel called, I think, The Good War. It was told in the words of the subjects themselves.	0
Dickens' shortest novel is an attack on utilitarianism, the squelching power of schools and factories to eliminate joy from life among the rich and poor alike. (Dickens perhaps prefigures Orwell with his Coketown of horror.) While some of the business about labor unions is unsuccessful, the love/despair story of Louisa Gradgrind is superbly rendered. A very good novel for those unsure of themselves in life!	1
I have this as a paperback but didn't want to dig it out of storage before seeing John Carter of Mars. I wanted to refresh my memory of this fun story. It is a dry narration of John Carter's experience. As I was thinking, the movie butchered the story. I originally read this story in junior high along with the entire series. This is a storystory best read and not seen at the theaters. I've also read the Gor series which has a similar storyline.	1
While the story and characters are good, what really draws me into this series is the information on prehistoric man. Did you ever wonder how people figured out fire or how to tame horses, why one species of pre-human eventually won out over another, how knowledge was passed down, how people spent their days, how they explained biological processes? What customs established in prehistoric times have influenced today's culture? This series gives you insight into all these things and more.There is a bit of fantasy in this novel, but the facts are incredibly well-researched by the author (medicinal herbs!).Once you've read this first book, you will have to read the rest.This is the first historical fiction I have read - it has opened my eyes to the genre.(The later books in the series have more sexual themes, so parents might want to discuss books with their teens who are reading it.)	1
We are using the activities from this book at our 4-H Club meetings. The age range is from 9 - 18 and I have had not problems finding activites that work for everyone.	1

"I found this book to be very dry and boring. I tried to compare this to The Giver, and I just conuldn't. I know that there are some good points to it, but not enought to sit and read it over and over again.PS-If you don't agree with me, please don't click the ""No"" button below."	0
This book is one of the most overrated books I have ever read. There is very little in the way of plot and character development. There is no climax in this book. The book reads like a historical record, similar to Tolkiens Silmarillion, rather than an actual story. If you like reading historical records, you may like this book. If you are looking for an exciting novel.... better luck elsewhere.	0
"THE SECRET BOOKS OF THE EGYPTIAN GNOSTICS by Jean Doresse is another great scholarly work free from ""New Age"" claptrap & commercialist distortion. The book is particularly relevant as French author Doresse was literally one of the first Westerners to actually see the original Nag Hammadi texts discovered in 1947. Although Doresse is a Christian proponent with a thinly veiled hostility to Gnostic tradition, he provides a wealth of reference material and, like Kurt Rudolph, indicates a possible interaction with Gnostic beliefs and Paganism--particularly in Alexandria, the motherland of Gnostic Paganism. This book is a MUST READ for any serious student of the origins and practices of Gnostic Philosophy.Gospel of Judas and Other Gnostic Secrets Revealed"	1
If you know it all already, this is a good book for you to buy. If you are looking for grammar instruction, look elsewhere. This little book was written 75 years ago and it has things worth thinking about, but it is not a grammar book, or a book on speaking, or a book on writing. I just bought it and am delighted to rummage about in it. It's a GEM. It's worth the money by a mile and a half. I gave it two stars only to not be lost in the shuffle. Buyers often don't look at 50 rave shill reviews but they'll look to see who doesn't like and why. So maybe I caught some readers. This is a good buy IF you KNOW IT ALL. It's not instruction, it's food for thought.	0
I bought this movie cause I love all the old movies. This DVD was in good shape and all in all I loved it.	1
It is evident that the previous reviewer who uses profanity - totally uncalled for - has used this forum to simply bash Clay. He has not purchased the CD nor listened to it. Let's grow up and use this for the reason it is intended - to review the CD, not bash the artist.The CD is awesome, and as time will tell, cream always rises to the top.....	1
"This book should be called ""white girl culture""... there is hardly an ethnic looking girl in the book! Lots of suburban teen-age girls looking like they are trying to be fit in. Nothing really insightful, new or surprising. Some photos are a bit interesting but most are overly self-conscious from subject and photographer... sorry but these images are easy to forget,(and border on teasing male viewers)... save your money and wait for the video!"	0
I found this boot very light and comfortable plus the fact that it's waterproof. it fits perfect in my size, it's warm and breathable too. I liked the colour very much and I was very pleased to find the product in such a good price, compared with other hiking boots that they are not waterproof at all. So far I haven't had the chance to try my boot in a heavy terrain like mud or snow but I believe that they are made for such surfaces.	1
Being a collector of period pieces, I have never watched a collection with such aweful picture quality. Do not buy this collection if you want mediocre or good quality viewing.	0

This book is like a bad soap. No action. No drama. Very predictable. It is about a woman who cheated on her husband with another man. The baby dad is the preacher. Why the couple couldn't have gotten a divorce is beyond me. And the writing is horrible. Maybe Webster would have fun with this book but not a high schooler being forced to read it. Reading this is like a punch in the testicles.. it HURT!!! This book is hell on earth. Don't read it. By the way, I had to give it one star.	0
I didn't like this book it was way to confusing, i don't think teachers should make kids read this book it is definantly not a kids kinda book.	0
"It's my third read of this book. First two I read about ten years ago, when my English hasn't been that matured, so after reading the book in original, I immediately found a copy in my native language. Now I decided to read the whole saga and of course started from the very beginning.Just as addictive as before. And with fair certainty I can say that this is the saga that has inspired George Lucas or whoever he took his ideas from. And yet it all started with ""Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire""..."	1
While this guide does not go indepth with each reptile and each terrarium type, it does provide all the information that you need as you look into setting up and maintaining a terrarium and selecting reptiles. The reptile information is broken down with easy to understand symbols and includes reptile characteristics, diet, behavior, times of day they are most active, level of difficulty for the reptile's care, terrarium size, type, substrate, temperature, and other habitat items that are needed to care for that reptile.This guide is well beyond the simple quick reference guide I was looking for!	1
a good read with much information from the early america era. Booker T. Washington use the brain over violence and suceeded where others failed. excellent read.!!!!	1
"Yes, everyone has a tale to tell, and it is the standard Binchy tale: someone is a mistress, someone *has* a mistress, someone feels trapped in his/her marriage... I started off with Binchy, relieved that these were not ""romance novels,"" but three or four books into her plethora, I find them to be glorified Barbara Cartlands. The difference is, in the more recent ones, they all sell food."	0
I bought this for my 15 year old brother after hearing about it on the radio. It took an eternity to find. It seems this little pup is the hottest little gadget of the year. It will amaze you. Just think of something and answer it's 20 questions and it will (most of the time) guess what you are thinking. After seemingly unrelated questions, it still somehow manages to get ya. It's witty little comments in between questions will irk you a bit. Everyone in my family enjoyed it....from my 15 year old brother (who hardly saw the poor thing) to my 60-something year old Grandmother. The price is unbeatable (I got it for $10), but I hear that it's on the rise, due to the demand. It's also very conveniently sized. No larger than a tennis ball, this is excellent to take along on road trips. The whole family can play.	1
This little cup warmer works pretty well, but don't think it will reheat a cup of coffee, it won't. It just keeps what's in there hot. I've found that it will heat up about a half cup from luke warm to drinking strength in about 20 minutes, but that's about it.I use my warmer at work for my last cup of the day that I nurse for a couple hours and it's saved me a lot of time going to and from the office kitchen to use the microwave.I wish it had an auto shut off feature, not that I've left it on overnight, but it gets decently hot, so that could be a concern.	1
Interesting film set in Vietnam brings up the whole issue of morality in war. Can morality exist in war? Is there such an animal? In such a graphic film depicting death, carnage and rape where does one draw the line? Penn is excellent as usual but Fox probably cast for his mere presence, as a character of virtue may be the real casualty here that diminishes the impact of the director's intentions. This film contains one of Ennio Morricone's best latter scores.	1
Too much swearing! Books do not need all that to make a good story, it is very distracting	0
"What a pathetic, degrading waste of talent on the part of actor Bela Lugosi, cast ludicrously in what comes close to equaling such bottom-of-the-barrel schlock as BRIDE OF THE MONSTER. And yet...and yet......if you love Lugosi's mellifluous, Hungarian-accented intonations (as I do), just sit back and ignore (or ""enjoy"") the film's imbecilic dialogue, implausible plot, stilted acting, and utterly hilarious direction, and allow yourself to be carried away by the erstwhile treasured voice that gave Bela Lugosi the fame and stature he so rightfully deserved back in the 30s from such memorable films as THE RAVEN, THE BLACK CAT, THE INVISIBLE RAY, SON OF FRANKENSTEIN and, of course, DRACULA."	0
What A Stinkbomb! A cross between a video game & high school play, what were they thinking? One blaring fault is that No One Smoked! How can you make a film about WWI & not admit they smoked? This bunch did & it really bothers me as it's playing the past - this is a trend I'm seeing in American productions about history - what else are they changing that young audiences won't pick up on?	0
"My 13 year old son is very pleased with this product.The only problem I had with AMAZON is they marketed it on the screen with a protective skin and power cord to buy ""as a bundle"". Unfortunately, the skin that was shown on the screen did not fit. Not good, AMAZON!"	1

Worst printer I've ever bought. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!!!! Constant Paper Jams, thick black line through scans/copies even after troubleshooting, annoying polling every couple minutes. This is probably going to be the last HP printer I ever buy. I was ripped off for a premium-line printer. I'm replacing it with a cheaper but more reliable Canon MP160 which does everything this one was supposed to and I've never had a single problem with it.	0
I first looked through this cookbook in another lady's kitchen. She had it all earmarked and I could tell she had tried many of the recipes. I knew this lady was a great cook, so I ordered it myself. I'm pretty picky about which cookbooks I keep. This one is very nice. I love all the seafood recipes. A classic.	1
"Supposed being victimized by local communist regime and Soviet oppressors since August-1968, a skilled surgeon changed countries and jobs like surgical gloves he did at hospitals.No wonder, sex is a fix for such a lucky, and marriage to a beautiful adorable woman stopped a character with Southern European rather than Slavic appearance a little.Extended up to 165 minutes of screening, romantic tale with some near-porno inclusions is a bit more over-positive and over-entertaining than its final collapsed in.Well, movie spirit seems being similar to ""A Beautiful Life"", ""Producers"" or, more recent one of Levi's Hitler-as-a-comedy-hero, of what optimism and humoristic style used to depicting the tragedy serve well cinemagoers seeking a relaxation only."	1
what can i said , i just love them , They got flexy wings almost like Cruisers. the price is good you pay no tax buying online , and you get it in two day right iny your door. yes , i mean two days .	1
It started with a great plot...until he actually wrote it. It was overwritten (it takes pages before something happens) and the protagonists were hard to like. Boring, sappy novel written as if he trying to imitate Victorian prose. There are a couple twists, but the main characters are such morons, it underscores the little action that does happen.	0
"You've heard of B rate spaghetti westerns and B rate scifi, Well I give this ""D"". Gary's son needs to get a really good part with some really good acting in it, or he is gonna be type cast forever. Like the first guy said, If your a fan of really bad Scifi, then this movie is for you. I should have rented it before I bought it. It would have been cheaper, and it wouldn't be in my collection. On a better note, The Asylum does put out some pretty good B rate stuff. Later Dudes."	0
Very good moving, it puts a human spin on the Batman franchise. I highly recommend anyone to see this movie.	1
I listened to all the reviews I read and let me tell you they are written by fanatics. I love the Scorps. The Scorps used to rock. I wish I could return this concert video in little pieces. The sound is junk the music is limp and the vocals are done. Don't waste you money on this video. Sorry Scorps. Your done..............	0
1984 is a great read but not a compelling one. It can be a little hard going at times. The characters are a little frustrating thus making it a little annoying to read. Still it is a great classic and well worth persuing to the end.	1
I was quite let down by the lack of real substance and information in the accounts. It is a great subject but the shallow treatment did not hold my interest. Ambrose's Citizen Soldiers is much, much better.	0
I though this cd wasn't bad for a first one. I would too like to hear more of his voice, but it seems that no matter what songs he sings, it can melt you heart. I don't have any kids of my own, but this is the type of cd that anyone at any age can listen to without having to worry about the ratings. Good job. He will just get better and better with more experience.Oh and for those of you who are looking forward to Ruben's cd, I heard rumors about it that I'm not sure are true, but many of you might be dissapointed in that one too. I heard it was going to be alot of hip hop type songs and not the soul songs that everyone is expecting. I hope this is not true, but if the cd is anything like the song he sang at the concert, it will definately be more hip hop.	1
"Saw this when I was just a kid. Finally got my own copy. A good addition if you like ""B"" rated sci-fi movies."	1
This is a wonderful book. I am new to the Catholic faith and had many questions. This book answered them all. It is very informative without being too long. I could not put it down. Now that I have finished reading, if I need to answer a quick question, I can look it up in this book. There are many misconceptions about the Catholic faith and this book set them all straight. It is wonderful for someone who is a cradle Catholic, a new Catholic, or protestant who wants to learn the truth about Catholicism.	1
Many readers will fail to realise that such a tragic life was the common lot of young, attractive poverty stricken women ages ago just as it is today. Children and teens continue to be sold and/or directed to a life of drudgey, service or near slavery, if not in fact slavery, by parents knowing no way out of their own dire conditions. That poverty worldwide continues to dictate a similar fate for young ones today while we, in comfortable surroundings, debate the merits of a novel, here in America, is a sad legcy indeed for a tale of warning, and unfortunately, of prediction. It is all well and good to fasten ones attention on a good resd-but pray do not miss the point! Hypocrisy lives on when the book is finished.	1
This short (80 pages), very pictorial guidebook to rose growing manages to convey to the reader the rich, exciting history of rose growing and the vastness of the industry in present days. It tells about how rose groweres manipulated and expanded the species, but also provides the novice back yard gardener with an easy to follow guide to buying and caring for roses. Many of the accompanying pictures are gorgeous. Of course they are - they ARE roses, after all.	1
During my search for the perfect bra, this is the best I have found so far. It only gets 4 stars because despite the high cost of this line of bras, the underwires do eventually break even if you care for them appropriately. The entire Le Mystere line offers unparalleled support for large busted women. Note that the cups aren't true to size. I normally wear a 40F, but wear a 40G in this line of bras. I highly recommend getting a professional bra fitting before buying this or any other bra.	1
The first time I finished this book, I tried to tell all my friends and family members about the story, but could not find the words. I am so glad my fellow readers have the same difficulty in describing this wonderous tale!The second time I finished this book, I was no closer to having a description than before...and so it goes into the 4th, 5th, and even 10th reading.However, you would have to look long and hard to find more beautiful fiction. Trust me on this one...read it and enjoy a once-in-a- lifetime experience...you will be glad you did!	1
This was the first Brenda Jackson book I've read. I was really into the book the whole time but was greatly disappointed in the ending. It seemed to me as thought the author put a lot of details and drama throughout the book and then such a flat/dry ending. Overall a good read. I do recommend it.	1
"I also found this $75 book to be more valuable than a $1000 ""No Pass No Pay"" Family Medicine Review Course. While that review course really delivered excellent information, little of it actually appeared on the exam. In contrast, this book contains questions very close to what you actually see on the test. Sure there are little mistakes and some annoying repetition of topics but nothing any of us could not get beyond. If you are not doing general geriatric and pediatric care or obstetrics, this book serves as a great starting point to explore the latest thinking. Similarly, if you don't do primary care, make sure to memorize the USPSTF and ACIP guidelines. Most importantly, do as many questions as you can from the ABFM website. I passed with above average scores but would have done even better if I had reviewed more of their sample questions. Good Luck."	1
I liked this, my guests said it was comfortable. It stayed inflated for the 7 days of guests and no one complained about it.	1
This little guy is awesome! Bought it for my daughters 3rd birthday party. She loves it, and I know the kids will get a kick out of it. For the price it is a great buy. Not for commercial or high volume use, but perfect conversation piece at small parties or soirees .	1
If you are a very senior Senior, be careful of the pop-up enticements you do not understand. There is no way I can ever view the movie I have been wanting to see for a very long time. I now know that I have DVD and not Blu-Ray, whatever that is. Reaching anyone to question is a near impossibility in this sales-mad world. The saddest thing is that I have not found anyone in my area to whom I can just give this movie in exchange for an opportunity to view it. Disappointed Old Lady	0

I tried Swaddlers, Huggies Snug N Dry and this one.1. Huggies and Baby Dry are functionally equivalent but not as good as swaddlers. This one is softer than Huggies.2. Not as good and leak proof as Pampers Swaddlers.Verdict: Buy Swaddlers upto size 2 and then switch to this one from size 3.	1
I bought this batcave for the grandson for Christmas because the older model was no longer available. I was leery about the height of the toy and the bad reviews, and with good reason. Every time I turn around, there's a piece of it that has to be put back on. And I didn't realize until I read the other reviews that there is an elevator. Ours has never worked. My grandson likes the toy, but is getting bored with it, since it's always falling apart and quite a few of the gadgets don't really work. Don't buy this toy!!	0
This pepper mill does not work well at all, it takes a lot of hand crunching to get the pepper ground and the refill 'twist off' plastic cap on the bottom on mine does not even open.The lip of the plastic cap hits the side of the pepper mill plastic body not allowing the refill cap to come off ! I used it until it ran out of pepper and that's it. Writing the manufacturer to get a refund. Shoddy construction. Get yourself a good old-fashioned wooden pepper mill.	0
Certainly this 2nd symphony should have shown the world Raff was a rising star. The opinion of his contemporaries that Raff was one of the greats is borne out here. The 2nd movement is so lyrical, it is worth the price of the disk by itself. The orchestra, though perhaps not well known, gave an outstanding performance. It is a pity that my CD from Amazon contained no program notes unlike what another reviewer reported. However, I'm very pleased with this very fine disk and strongly recommend it to anyone who enjoys hearing Romantic era works that ought to be better known!	1

What is it about Reggae that makes it so appealing to the masses? Maybe the fact that it's like the coolest type of music in the world? I mean, Willie William's Armageddon Time in 100% really blew the people away. This time around in 500%, expect the same thing, but the fact that it's so cool shouldn't mean a damn thing. A real Summertime c.d. Suck down the cerveza, smoke the cohiba, and listen to these bad boys.	1
What to say about this movie? Terrible, wooden, hack acting. Bad/uneven lighting. Terrible CGI special effects. Hitler's over-acting head on a bad CGI robotic body. Nazi UFO. Hack job rip-off ofIron Sky.Frankly, the special features, for what they are, are actually more interesting than the movie itself. Not that they're super-interesting. But thee are features on pre-production, cast & location and one on the main production. Each one is all of about 5+ minutes long.And there's a commentary track.But those are about the only special features and hardly salvage this stink-burger.Overall, I'll rate this one a 'pass.' I might pick up Iron Sky at some point and see if it's any better, what-so-ever. One can hope. But the general premise is hokey to begin with, so I'm not holding out much hope on that one either. =o\	0

We have a 5mo old baby boy and his 18pounds not 19 just yet. We just bought the #3 on 3/5/12. This size leaks everything!I rate #3 A BIG ZERO. Don't get us wrong we loved loved loved #1 & 2's maybe because it had the leak lock.#3 is not made right. The plastic inside directs anything..pee or poop right out. Our baby leaked both things from the back and around the thighs. OMG we had to change his entire outfit 4 times in one day.I wish we can get our money back but we threw the box in trash =( Diapers are expensive. Stores should have some sort of policy where parents can get their money back esp if they have not opened the 2nd pack and hardly used the 1st.I will keep you posted what happens and what we find that works for us. Good luck everyone	0

Coyote Ugly has the worst cgi and special effects I have never seen before in all my years of movie bashing. Actually, I just started watching movies last week. Due to Coyote Ugly, I'll never watch another bad movie again.	0
This stuff is easily the most trite and cliche collection of prose on love and romance that I've ever read. I was expecting a good deal more. The writing seems to come from the mindset of an intellectually arrested suburban kid who hasn't experienced much of life or the world beyond his college campus and his few so-called love affairs.	0
Krishnamurti himself asked people not to pay attention to his immature teachings (prior to about 1933). For a scholar this book gives a look into K's mind as a youngster but it doesn't portray the important elements of his teachings which flourished after around 1933.	0

I order this item almost every month my daughter has been in size 3's for about 5 months or so. You can not beat the price on this site its pretty amazing. However, I have noticed that with each order it takes longer and longer for them to arrive. Its pretty annoying that they cant seem to get them here any faster and so dont wait to order them if you are going to need them within the next 2 weeks order them cause chances are they will take that long to get there. Pretty sad but with the price I guess they have to mess you up somewhere. I was disappointed because I went off the last time I ordered and the amount of time they took and this time it took 3 days longer. So I had to run to the store and pay full price :(All in all great product Pampers always are but be careful ordering from here when your in a rush!	1

"Yes, all the reviews are correct: This is an excellent writer detailing some of the most gruesome killings of all time. It is the fastest 650 pages you will ever read, I gaurantee it.One note: This book might also be called ""Vincent Bugliosi: The Man Who Brought Down Charles Manson And Lived to Tell About It."" That is to say, Bugliosi is evidently proud (rightfully so) of his accomplishment as the lead prosecutor on the case. And he pretty much makes mincemeat out the intellect of the LAPD and the defense attorneys involved. But like any good prosecutor (and Bugliosi is most certainly that) he has quite a bit of evidence to back his charges of ineptitude. If I were Kanarek, or a Tate detective, I'd be pretty embarrassed knowing this book is an all-time bestseller.But who are we kidding, this is the definitive book on Tate-Labianca. A truly fantastic read."	1

When I was younger I had a crocadile dentist that you actually pulled the teeth out, thats what I was expecting. This was a travel size one that all you do is push the teeth, not very fun.

I recently read Theodore White's books on the Presidential campaigns of 1960, 64, 68 and 72. I was thinking this book would be a good read to keep going in chronological order... I don't want to quit reading too soon but the book has a tone that makes me wonder if it was written in the 1970s.. It is incredibly dated and the author appears to me to be clearly pushing a very conservative viewpoint. He seems to be selective in what he talks about and does quite a bit of editorializing. Don't think I am going to bother finishing it.	0
"This little book is so much fun. It was written in 1954 so half of the fun is looking at salaries and other data from that time. Huff points out with goofy pictures but sound logic how you can be hoodwinked by the use and abuse of ""averages"" and a number of other ways that statistics are quoted. I use it to make sure that in my work I'm not fooling myself or misinterpreting numbers and charts."	1
Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man	1
It's hard to believe that this book was released by a major publisher. It is rife with misspellings and grammatical errors. The thin index is almost useless, as a close examination reveals it to be mostly a list of the author's friends and their nicknames.	0
Been long time since last read..still worth a re-reading..everyone should pass there once or twice in their life; during adoloesence when less tolerant and understanding of its content to complete a class assignment..and later after many life experiences to better appreciate and relate more of its content.	1
1984 is a great book. It really makes you think. thee plot is a very interesting one about a dictator ruining everything, but the scary part is they have so much power you can't say anything against their party. This book is very good for those epeople who like to really think about things and take them deep. I would not recommend this title for action fiends.	1
This series is about the guilt three different people feel involving the death of Sammy, who is a twin brother to Kyra. This book is Kyra's point of view. This series is interesting because there are three different points of view and you get to see how each person tells the story. This book was absolutely amazing! Everything in this book was so real, I could actually see something like that happening in my town and in my highschool. Everyone can relate to something in the book, maybe even more than one thing. I could not put it down and found myself staying up late just to get further into the book! I can't wait to read the next book, Miranda's story. I would recommend this book to all teen girls out there or anyone else looking for a great read! You won't be disappointed, I know I wasn't!	1
"Four stars for the creative band, KISS, and for these strong, early records. This box is new from Universal and includes the first three CDs, ""Kiss,"" ""Hotter Than Hell"" and ""Dressed To Kill."" The actual discs are dated ""1997,"" so they are probably the original remasters, and not new remasters, I am guessing. The box includes the three CD covers of the orignal three CDs, but no additional artwork or liner notes. Although some might prefer the 1980s work and beyond, KISS' strong period will always be the 1970s, and their pre""Alive"" recordings are found here."	1
"I read ""No Disrespect after reading ""The Coldest Winter Ever"", and finding that work of fiction riveting, and well -told. I found ""No Disrespect"" a non-fiction work that is told with the caveat - I will tell the truth, and the names are changed only to protect the innocent"", to be poorly told, hard to believe, and self serving. Yes, I do believe it is possible to have morals and values as SS describes herself to have in this work, but the stories she writes, rather than honest, smack of someone that is holding back, or more to the point someone tailoring the story to conclude in an ending that is suitable to them. I don't mean any disrepect, but I don't buy it was the prevailing thought as I read her story."	0
I absolutely adore Heart and hadn't heard this album in years! I actually purchased it for my mom and it hasn't left her CD player since.	1
This story is so true and one of my favorites. Meet Francie, the daughter of Katie and Johnny Nolan, who don't have much future in store for their intelligent and bookworm daughter. You learn about Francie, the so honestly true story. It's amazing that it isn't your story. The slums of Brooklyn come to life in this touching story. If you did not enjoy this book you have no passion for life, or no feelings for those who do exsist but you push them out of your mind.	1
I don't understand how a DVD that hasn't been released yet has received so many reviews-all of them great. Has this DVD been released elsewhere?	0
"This books is very very awesome.Miranda is a supposed good-goody, and when she's told to ""lighten up,"" she does so. She takes drugs, throws outrageous parties and gets drunk.When a very vlose friend of hers dies at one of her parties, she's guilt tricken and wants to committ suicide.Does she do it? Read and find out.It's an amazing book that a person should read."	1
FINALLY!! A REAL historian who writes from a position of sympathy towards modern witches and pagans while unceremoniously debunking most all of the pet fantasies held by many feminist oriented authors today. Of course, I don't agree with ALL of what he says here, but boy did he ever open a can of worms and make me think! I am so glad this book is out there and hope that it finds its way into the syllabus of some of the Christian colleges. I know....but we can hope, right?	1
Classic Chick-lit. Fun, sexy, juicy, leave you wanting more book about love and all things girls. These books keep me out of therapy. ;)	1
I BOUGHT THIS ITEM AS A GIFT. I PUT BATTERIES IN IT AND IT WORKED FOR THREE MINS AND QUIT. I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO GET IT TO WORK AGAIN AND ACCORDING TO AMAZON POLICY I CAN'T RETURN IT! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY!	0
Here it comes! The big movie of the hilarious TV series, it's The Spongbob Squarepants Movie! Spongbob and Patrick are on a mission to save King Neptunne's crown, and they travel a long long way. Despite my two stars, the move has it's moments when you laugh and giggle. But the movie lost the essance of the series: It wasn't that funny.Spongebob was the icon of goody-goodness-fun. But then the movie is a huge letdown and there should be a sequel to imrpove the series.The funny moments are when Patrick falls in love with the mermaid, (I think her name was Cyndi?) and he's like 'Your Pretty!' Same old Patrick, the character that stays consistent.Movie is worth a rent. Some crude humor and weird images.	0
My 1 star rating is due to the fact that Oxford University Press gives away the plot twists and even the shocker ending in the second paragraph of their Introduction. Most of the fun of reading any novel is trying to find out what will happen next. Oxford spoils this by giving it away at the start (what were they thinking?!!!). If you pick up this edition, just skip the Intro, or read it AFTER the book. Otherwise, Hardy's novel is a great story with insight into noble character. Hardy gets 5 stars, Oxford U Press gets 1.	0
this Book takes you on a journey for knowledge and understanding. it speaks to gaining something that is powerful that will be a stepping stone for better days and times ahead. this Book deals with expierences and coming to terms with life and how it has been dealt and the choices that you have to make.alot of issues and challenges are met head on and dealt with. very strong and well written book.	1
I give this book one star because it made nice lining for my bird cage. Others have described, more eloquently than I can, why this is not a good book to read. I found the author mean, pompous and racist. As a climber of many years I can honestly say I would never tie into a rope with her.	0
This is not a review, it's a rave. This is not some piece of self-conscious, tricked out, contempo ironic (the knowing wink in the voice), cooler than thou vocabulary popcorn or breathy lil grrl prom panic whine. This is real music. The full range of expression. It will move you. Watch out.	1
I cant wait to get this movie on Blu Ray..I already own the first 2 but its gonna be worth seeing them on Blu Ray in HD!!	1
Awesome movie. Loads of action. Finally find out how Wayne becomes Batman. The 4 previous movies never told you how he became Batman all you knew was he was batman and his parents were killed. In Batman Begins you find out how he becomes Batman. Well worth it. I love the way they set up for the sequel. Katie Holmes is hot.My order of the Batman movies go like this:1)Batman2)Batman Begins3)Batman Returns4)Batman Forever5)Batman and Robin witch was ok but was pretty dumbThe order of the batmans themselves goes like this:1)Micheal Keaton2)Christian bale3)Val KilmarThe worse Batman was George Clooney good actor but not a actor to play Batman sorry George.	1
Romeo and Juliet is a wonderful read. I loved reading every minute of it. The summaries and the explanatory notes help you understand everything about it. This is a great book and I would recommend you read this as an introduction to Shakespeare. I did and I am now going to start A Midsummer Night's Dream. Read this book! You'll love every minute of it!	1
Beautifully illustrated and easy to follow instructions. The patterns, sewing instructions and examples are written in a way that anyone, beginner or novice will complete equally beautiful works.	1
Have used this product before and was quite pleased with it so when I saw it on sale at Amazon I bought two bottles. Not sure if what I got was the real stuff or if it was grossly past the expiration date but it did not compare to what I had bought at the Molton Brown store before.I ended up throwing the stuff away and bought a new bottle directly from MB. I will never again buy this product on Amazon. I will buy from a MB store to make sure I get a quality product.	0
"This book was an enormous disappointment. Though it states it is a book for all ages, I would like to see my 25-65 year olds on my sales staffs, playing things like ""Rabbit & the Carrot"" or""Magic Carpet Ride."" This was for very young children, at best. Most of these games were not unique, creative, or interesting. A true waste of money."	0
Since this game gave no dimensions, I had to guess at it's size. From the photos that I saw, I assumed that the toy would be bigger then it actually was. It is small, about the size of my fist. The idea of the game is to keep pressing teeth until you reach the sore one, at which time the jaw will snap shut. However, the jaw very frequently pops off completely when snapping shut and requires an adult to put it back together. The teeth often do not reset after the jaw has snapped shut and have to be manually pried back into position to be able to play again. All in all, a disappointment and not worth the money it would cost to send it back.	0
"One of the best baseball legend biographies I've read. It moved quickly, but thoroughly...a very enjoyable read. Although the term ""page-turner"" is clich√©, that's what this is."	1
Professor Yoo's writing style is as nearly befuddled and confused as his understanding of a Constitutional law. I can say without fear of contradiction that this is by far one of the most ill-conceived, unsubstantive and pointless books I have ever had the misfortune to read. His theories and assertions are never clearly backed up with any real documentation or legal reasoning and he fails miserably in making any clear or concise point. I feel this book was nothing more that a total waste of time. Perhaps Professor Yoo should stick to writing legal arguments, where style and in his case substance, don't really matter.	0
"I wasn't expecting much when I rented this DVD at Blockbuster, and I was right not to.It takes place in Antarctica, but none of the actors look like it is cold outside. CGI is ridiculously cheesy (typical of a SyFy movie), far too many closeups of the actors' faces on the outside shots (clearly an attempt to conceal the fact they are on a movie set) and SPOILER ALERT! the worst ""robot Hitler"" CGI you can imagine.Nothing that happened in this movie surprised me one bit, and it is clear to see why Dominique Swain's and Jake Busey's careers circled the drain at least a decade ago.The only reason why I gave this film TWO stars instead of ONE is because the premise of the film attracted me: Nazis trying to restart the Third Reich from (insert place here).It's good for a few mindless laughs. Other than that, don't waste your time."	0
Very nicely constructed, and the service from the seller was truly rare in it's excellence and personally professionaly touch.The zafu was a tiny bit smaller than I expected, but it was exactly what it should have been. It was my expectation that was off. Great item.	1
As with others, this was a great camera until the remove cassette problem appeared 8 months ago. Now it barely plays or records. I'm never buying another Canon and going back to Sony. BTW, the buzzing is the automatic microphone gain. If there's not enough sound to record it cranks up the input volume so much that you hear the tape motor.	0
I read this book and hoped against hope for something new in vampire lore but it's basically the same old stuff not very interestingly written.	0
I bought this CD without even previewing it, as I'm a Moya fan. Even still, I was blown away by the beauty of it, the simplicity of the vocal lines, and the intricate way in which the tunes are arranaged. This is not your ordinary 'holiday' clone CD; with one more boring recording of the same dozen or so overdone Christmas carols! All of the tracks offer refreshing new 'advents' into the wonder of the Winter Solstice Season. A haunting, blissful album!	1
This was such a beautiful film. Breathtaking! The best part was watching it with my movie buddy Sandra Zhao! I cannot wait to see it again. I truly felt like the movie had taken me on a trip to Denmark. I have still not watched the Lives of Other's which beat Pan's Labyrinth and this movie for Best Foreign Film. Can't wait to see it.	1
Being a big fan of The Great Milenko and The Amazing Jeckel Brothers this is what i would expect from ICP. No fancy Lyrics but some funny stuff thrown in and the beats keep you movin'.	1
When will people stop digging for the lowest possible price? I would have paid three times this price to have a quality product. After three pumps the check valve that holds the air in the rocket failed. You would push the pump in and all the air would get sucked out of the rocket when you pulled the pump back out. Then the mounting nipple snapped off when releasing the rocket from the clamp. Never worked once! Would like to find one that works, but they all look the same.	0
"I really enjoyed ""Life is a Circus"" by Shirley Carroll O'Connor. It is a warm humorous love story and a first hand insight into what it was like being part of circus life in a bygone era. Shirley writes about of being a newly wed on a Circus train, learning the ropes and class system of Circus life, living on the road and about the friends the bride made among the performers and side show acts. What better training for a woman who later became one of Hollywood's top Press Agents than sharing your life (and car) with wild and dangerous animals. O'Connor's perspectives and insights into the Circus culture can be appreciated by circus fans or anyone who likes a good autobiographical story. Her idea of a bad day was when she (literally) lost a heard of elephants in downtown Hollywood. I found myself smiling and laughing my way through this book. Buy, borrow, or check this book out of the library, it is a great read."	1
The author does a great job of taking the reader inside the historic 2002 U.S. Open at Bethpage Black, and includes all the main players involved. Be advised that the book does not focus much on the action at the Open, only the last 75-100 pages deal with the actual championship, the rest involves the story behind bringing the championship to the club. The book is a good read and will be enjoyed by any golf fan, not the best Feinstein has ever written, but one of his best.	1
Without any knowledge of programming whatsoever, the reader learns the main programming aims (input, storage, evaluation, repetition, comparison/selection, and output) using Visual Basic as an example paradigm.A lot of hands-on exercises are provided throughout. A complete application is gradually developed through all the chapters, together with smaller applications which illustrate specific points.While the editing of the book leaves something to be desired (e.g., incomplete sentences, punctuation errors, occasional code inaccuracies), this is a very worthwhile book indeed. I highly recommend it for the author's lack of assumptions and obvious understanding of the beginner's needs.	1
In many ways, this Beowulf is a lot of fun for kids. The writing is direct and clear (although there are plenty of vocabulary stretchers). The action is fun. Beowulf's heroism is unquestionable.But, I don't understand why one would publish a Beowulf retelling and stay just close enough to the original to be confusing (as opposed to John Gardner's wonderful Grendel, which told the story from the monster's perspective). The most disturbing divergence was making Unferth a petty bad guy in enamored of evil. In doing so, Nye sacrifices much of the nobility of the original.I don't know if there are other kid-friendly tellings of this story. But, I would look for one of those, first.	0
The story of hester is by itself a master piece worthy of its highly commended status, however the annotated version really helps the reader understand the historical references and many archaic words.	1
We LOVE Papmers and the ease of having them delivered to my home is fantastic! It actually worked out cheaper for me to have them delivered than for me to pick them up on my own and I don't have to lug the bulky boxes around. An added benefit in my opinion! I just wish I would have disocvered this two and a half years ago when my twins were born!!!!!	1
Most of the book was interesting although the spots classifying the sea life boring and I breezed through those pages to get to the more interesting areas. All in all, a good read and worth the time. Besides, you can't beat the price to read a classic!!	1
"I am a very big fan of horror movies, I have been snice I was around 5 or so. This was on sometime during Hallooween on AMC, and it was always one of the ""100 Most Horror Movies"" on Bravo. When I watched it before that show was on I saw a few parts and though to myself when does the good part come?..But I ended up about to fall asleep so I taped it, but not every part came on, then I watched it again and though to myself this is not even scary what makes it so scary?...The movies mostly about a young women and her husband who want a kid, then when she gets it(supposly she's rapped by the devil), and her kids the devil living inside her, but nothing really scary happened I was pretty dispointed."	0
Bought this for my wife on a recommendation from a friend, she read a few pages and quit because it was too sad. I told her it had a good ending but she won't try again, be prepared for tears when you read this one.	0
Bought a set of the i6775, the lookk was great and it was expandable. After 1o days the handet of the base went dead, changed the baterry and still no luck, although the other handsets, would even charge at the base. Took it back to Office Depot, and they gave me another system right away. Although I los all the memory information, I was pleased that they eschange it. And believe it or not, the new set, after 10 days had the same, exact, problem. Contacted Vtech for their opinion and was on hold for more than 20 minutes, so I hanged up and when to Office Depot and they reimburse me right away. Do not even look at Vtech ohones, their support system is the worst.	0
This is economic sanity. Easy to understand. If more people and especially those in government would read this book, we would be better off.	1
"I was really happy with my TiVo for the first 6 months. Then I received an error message that data wouldn't load. After researching on the TiVo website forums and finding many others have had the same problem, I followed their instructions and tried to ""kickstart"" it. This process did not fix the box but TiVo tells me I crashed my TiVo. TiVo says I need to return it and they will fix it under warranty, but they will not let me out of the service contract unless I pay $200 termination fee since it is under warranty and they've offered to fix it. Personally, I would prefer to go back to my cable company's DVR - the box costs me nothing but the monthly fee which is half of what TiVo charges.TiVo has TERRIBLE customer service!!!!"	0
"This is a nice recording of swing and blues style guitar. Lots of fun to listen to -- like sitting in on a friendly jam session. Duke Robillard really shines on ""Avalon"" and the bluesier numbers and Herb Ellis sounds like he's having fun throughout. Recommended for swing fans or those new to jazz guitar."	1
This is the best Baby Dry Diaper for your special little one. Your baby really stays dry and comfortable specially during the night and the fitting is great.	1
This was a cute story, although not too original. Easy read. I would read this author again.Classic feel good love story.	1
"We were surprised and confused when opened up the Amazon shipping box. The battery has been removed from the retail packaging and wrapped in a bubble wrap with a seal labe said ""new"". When looked closely at the battery, it's obvious that this is not the same one as what we have in the camera. I'm not sure if $29.94 is a deal for a non-original battery. We strongly urge Amazon to faithfully update the product description, or this is considered a deceiving."	0
I was in my early twenties when this book found its way into my heart; I will never forget the sound of Sister Souljah's voice in my head, I could hear her words and feel the pain rising from the pages. Though it has been since the early nineties that I read No Disrespect, I will always heartily recommend Sister Souljah's grand debut; this book is pure heart; not easy to come by in these plastic times. I say, pick it up and give it a read, you won't be disappointed, and something might change within your soul, a new perspective, or even a song within your heart might be born and you might chance to sing along with No Disrespect ~ I think it takes guts to write like this, and this author has my full respect for putting herself out there. Not an easy thing to do. Sometimes its not easy to read a book chock full of opinions that one may or may not agree with; and that is the glorious thing about this book; new perspective, new horizons; freedom to think newly.	1
"As any fan of Nirvana is well aware, Kurt Cobain had a fear that was close to outright paranoia about Nirvana's music being milked and exploited to make a buck. All of a sudden, that fear seems totally legitimate.This is (basically) the 3rd ""Greatest Hits"" cd that's been released under the band's banner. Nirvana only had three studio released cds. Well ... four if you count 'Incesticide.'If you're a younger fan and you want a terrific introduction to the band's work save your money from cd and save up for the 'With the Lights Out' box-set. It doesn't cost too much and is a great way to break into the band.A true Nirvana fan understands that the only meaning behind this piece is dollar signs."	0
Beautifully written. The hopefullness underpining all the struggles of the mther and daughter explains alot about the immigrant experience at the turn of the last century.	1
I got these for my husband for christmas he liked them very much! The size is just perfect as he is not tall and they fit just right.	1
I purchased this book and attempted to use it as a resource for a trip to Cambodia in July 1999. The only current information in the entire country section was that Pol Pot has died. Cambodia is a fascinating place to visit...Too much has changed for this book to be of any use	0
"Clay has one of the most moving and true voices in music today. For the true Clay fan and those who love good pop music, this album will definitely not disappoint. Clay's talent shines on songs like ""The Way"",""Shine"", and the title song. He's got crossover appeal and a voice that speaks to the heart. I cannot wait to see how fast this album goes platinum! Applause!"	1
This book cost me the FRM last year. I made it the center of my study program. The book's writing is atrocious; there are gaps in what is covered; and there are many errors and misstatements. I wasted six weeks struggling with this book. When I finally realized my mistake, it was too late to rescue my study program, and I failed the exam. I am very disillusioned with Jorion and GARP. This shoddy, overpriced paperback makes me think they are in it just for the money. This year, I have signed up for the CFA exam instead. So far, I have been very impressed with their study materials.	0
"A Bunch of Women who want to be Men well not all of them, go into a Cave(no pun intended) and meet some interesting Things on the way down(That's what she said), and so these ""Things"" Or Creatures apparently have it out for them, Short and Silly review but hey it is what is,I did like the Movie and I certainly Enjoyed it More than The Descent 2."	1
"This book is one of the last masterpieces written as American literature moved from what we call ""Old English"" (use the much cliched Olde if you must) to ""New English."" And trust me, it shows. Virtually every book ever written during this period, (essentially, before Twain's Huckleberry Finn), bears the same markings - incredibly lavish diction, complex structure and syntax, and all the elements that make for a generally hard to follow novel. If you elevate your reading to that next level, where you're seeing beyond the simple plot and percieving Hawthorne's masterful use of symbolism and metaphor, and are able to appreciate probably the last great novel written in before the literary revival of the late 1800s, then you'll consider this book a worthwhile read."	0
Loved this series when I was very young with pleasant memories. Wanted to get them . Have gotten every one as they have been released. Have not been disappointed. Will continue till collection complete. Nostalgia is a warm fuzzy feeling watching this series from the past. Wow how styles and life has changed then.Perry has always been a favorite for me.	1
I haven't read Shirley Jackson's novel, but I've seen the old movie and this one. Compared to the 1963-movie, this one is quite different, at least the story. But I like it. I like the characters, they're quite similar to those in the original movie. The insecure, nervous Nell (Lili Taylor), self confident Luke (Owen Wilson) and Theo (Catherine Zeta-Jones). The actors are good (I forgot to mention Liam Neeson as Dr Marrow), also the supporting actors, for example Marian Seldes as the creepy Mrs. Dudley.The special effects are impressing and the music is also very good. One thing that feels unnecessary is that the filmmakers seem to have tried to give the movie a creepy, 'haunting', feeling too early, even in the end of the first scene, in Nell's bedroom.I like this movie and I think it's quite underrated. It has a number of good scenes. The scene with the photo album with the pictures of Hugh and Carolyn Crain is a favorite... It's nice to see a good new haunted house movie.	1
I bought three copies of this book as funny Christmas presents, and they were a big hit. One of the people I gave it to, just after opening it, began to read several small sections aloud to the rest of us, and it was very entertaining.	1
I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires.	1
Terrible direction, terrible writing, it almost feels like the director didn't know what he was working with. Although this movie wanted to be in the same race and quality of the movie CLUE, it fails to realize that the plot and characters are incredibly riculous and not funny ha ha but funny stupid. It was a total watse of good celluloid.	0
I bought this thing to get the names of songs on the New York spanish stations. I checked it, double checked it, called customer service, and STILL I got incorrect song information. Maybe its the radio stations fault, maybe its E-marker's fault, all I know is that it DOES NOT WORK.	0
Don't buy!!! This charger does not work. It broke twice before Amazon told me they would not send me another. The customer service was excellent from Amazon.	0
"kind of like hole, and kind of like sheryl crow, but personally i like garbage much better. If u buy the version 2.0 cd, make sure u listen to ""the trick is to keep breathing"". Garbage is a one of a kind band,they have a way with expressing a story with their music. Sooo...make sure u check out the version 2.0 cd, and the the soundtrack to ""BIG DADDY"""	1
"This doc does for Stalingrad what Ken Burns ""Civil War"" did to the ACW. Outstanding archival film research resulted in never before seen footage of Operation Blue & Stalingrad (especially life in the Kessel). 99% of the footage is genuine late 1942 vintage, and quite a bit in color. This is a MUST-SEE on HDTV. The doc also reveals a stunning secret regarding the Kessel, but I won't spoil it for you. I have $3K in English, Russian & German Stalingrad books/video, and I would buy this one again if I had the choice. You can't possibly regret this."	1
Yes, Cher and Moonstruck are better than Meg Ryan/Nora Ephron's films including When Harry Met Sally. There's something about the visuals of the Meg Ryan movies that always bothered me (Pottery Barn magalogues bother me) but Moonstruck is EXACTLY what I like from the real estate to the brick lipstick. There are even lucrative plumbing contracting and bread operations - ooh!	1
Mercedes Lackey is one of my favorite Authors. This book was such a let down, so much about nothing. The different plot lines were written by different people and you can tell where one picks up and one leaves off. it was a very irritating style.There are so many characters it's easy to mix them up. Some of the characters you never figure out why they are in the novel at all.It's too bad that I spent money on this book when I could have purchased a Mercedes Lackey Novel without help.	0
Didn't get to read it due to reading another book about Left Gomez and actually, i'm still not finish with that book.	0
We purchased this tripod for one of the larger Sony cameras that we also purchased through Amazon. The camera is awesome. The page for the camera recommended this tripod so we bought it from Antonline. This tripod is not nearly strong enough for use smoothly with our camera and when I contacted Antonline for a refund they refused to deal with me, even if I paid the shipping back to them. If you buy this tripod, beware that truly strong remote control tripods can start at $300 and go up from there.	0
"I was really excited to try this, however it is not for everyone. I have a ""flat"" stomach just flabby and then I have ""love handles"" so I thought this would just hold everything in but that's not how it worked for me. It feels great when I have it on but when I look in the mirror I have this pooch in the front that I didn't have before. It takes the extra from the sides and puts it all in the front. I think I would rather have the love handles. I do like the way it feels and the back support is great so I only wear it with baggy shirts. (Not exactly why I bought it but o well). I still gave it 4 stars because it is still working for me, just not how I thought it would."	1
This book will show you how we all want to define God as we want to, not as God wants. You will see yourself in the pages of this book and hopefully, you will make an honest effort to rise above your restrictive defintion of God. If so, it will have expanded your understanding of your world. This is a good book for a class in spirituality to discuss.	1
"""Creation Regained:Biblical Basics for a Reformational Worldview"" is not your typical worldview book. It comes at this issue from a particularly Reformational angle. What does that mean? He grounds his thesis in the way of looking at the world rediscovered during the Protestant Reformation: creation, fall, and redemption. When we consider life everything is considered from this biblical viewpoint. What Wolters presets is a great introduction to three points that can radically change the way we think and live. If you are looking for a worldview book that is heavy on applicable, biblical content rather than a rant about how the world is going to hell in a hand-basket this it the book for you."	1
"Of Mice and Men is one of the best books I've ever read! It's about friendship, racism, sexism, contrasts, etc. It's a very unique book and doesn't have a ""happily ever after"" ending, it's very unique. I won't spoiling anything, read it!"	1

Product is as shown but they didnt have it in stock and it took them almost a month to ship. And then instead of sending next day to compensate they sent it regular mail so it took another week to receive. Not too happy with their customer service.	0

"I've been a fan of Larry Carlton for quite some time, and I still listen to the ""Sleepwalk"" album and find it to be just as vibrant now as when it came out. Larry has always been a tasteful player but with just a bit of edge to make things interesting. This new album sounds much too carefully drawn. The guitar is too far down in the mix and Larry seems to be playing session man on his own album. The 2 selections with vocals don't really add anything for anyone looking for Larry Carlton. I hope his next album finds him reaching a bit and taking some chances."	0
Do not order this DVD. It does not work. The HD player will tell you that it cannot load it (error message) after 10 minutes of trying. Looks like everyone else has had this problem as well. I called Amazon for a refund and recommended that they pull this item. It DOES NOT PLAY.	0
The JVC Camcorder Model GR-SXM240 is one of the best I'veused in years. For the price you pay,you can't beat It.Sharp pictures even in low light conditions. I recommend thisCamcorder for every one to use.There is one problem while charging the battery the main circuitboard smoked. This board cost approx. $205.00. I recommend watching the camcoder when charging.	0
"As the mother of a teen who is a big Clay Aiken fan, I picked up this CD yesterday for her. We hardly ever buy music CD's anymore because there are usually only one or two good songs on them - and I expected this one to be the same. WRONG! Nearly every song on this album touched me in some way - I especially liked the song ""Shine."" This album is filled with very good music that a parent doesn't have to be concerned about their children listening to. And as for the big Clay Aiken fan in the house, she is thrilled with all the songs - the title track seems to be her favorite so far.Too bad the lyrics to the songs were not included along with the liner notes. Guess the producers decided to go with the fold-out Clay Aiken poster instead."	1
This book is old, gross looking. cover page is torn..the condition is definitely NOT GOOD..Got this book for $4...It's not worth more than 25 cents for sure.	0
Well researched and documented, and yet an interesting and pleasant book to read; I learned from this book many things I completely ignored about history of Nouvelle France. A dispassioned history of the wars among French colonists of Canada, Indians and the British colonists of the early American colonies.	1
I was very dissatisfied with this purchase because after I received the product, I found out that it was in a different language and I couldn't understand anything on the cd's.	0
r.kelly has done his best on this album.. the inspiration probably came from sex. from the intro to the last song, this music is tight. espcially all the slow jams are just the right songs to get into the sex mood with your man/woman.	1
This is not a condemnation of Initial D 4th Stage which is awesome. This is to warn people who care about such things that Funimation is flat out lying on their DVD boxes. They claim that the DVD's are 16:9 and they're not, they're 4:3 widescreen. Instead of filling the entire TV or even having black bars on the top and bottom, I have black bars on all four sides of the screen and it makes it useless to watch this on a large TV. I never would've bought this if I had known what was in store for me after I popped it into my player.	0
"I haven't read a Julie Garwood in 10 - 20 years. I did enjoy some; Lion's Lady, The Bride, and even ""The Secret."" But, nothing has changed with her historical novels. Still flaky and almost child-like heroines. This was a long and ridicules story. Sorry Julie, I have out grown your historical novels. I still think she is a talented writer, her contemporary novels are not that bad. Sorry . ):"	0
For the price it's great.It comes in a timely manner & price saving.I recommend to try the 3month subscription.You can beat the quantity & price.	1
My son and I had checked this book out from the public library and he loved it! He was so upset when we had to take it back so I decided to look online. We love Mexican food/culture and he thinks it's so funny after knowing the original song!I was so happy to have found it for his birthday!	1
This book was a school reading assignment. When I first began to read it I anticipated that it would be rather dumb. It turns out that i was correct. I could not become interested. It had the worst plot and why anyone would read it for the purpose of personal interest it is umm oh yea stupid. Summing up my review I think it never should have been written.	0
Don't bother with this book....The info is not up-to-date. I bought it used and cheap, and it still wasn't worth it.	0
My 10 month old lab chewed through this product within five minutes of his first walk. Thank god for the safety connected to the collar or who knows what would have happened.The design has a strap that goes right over the side of the mouth area. As the dog opens and closes their mouth, the strap goes tight and slack. When the strap is slack, the dog can chew on it. I would say that this is a major design flaw on a product designed to restrain your dog while on a walk.I wouldnt say that my dog is particularly bright so if he can figure this out within 5 minutes on his first walk I'm sure any dog can. If you are going to buy this, please make sure you attach the safety strap to the collar.	0
I am writing this recommendation because I am on a high because I just got my acceptance letter in the mail. I had gotten deffered from NYU but I GOT INTO BC which is a better college. This is an incredible and undeniably the best guide in the world to writing an essay.	1
This was ordered for a teenager who had it on his reading list. It was an excellent used copy and a great value for the money.	1
There is enough product on the mini pads to go over your entire face and neck. The fragrence of step 1 smells good.Overall this product does work. It definately clears up your face. I didn't use this product everyday since I wasn't sure if this was a product that contained 100% natural ingredients.	1
Okay, this was the first Night World book that I read, and it seemed pretty good. But compared to LJS's other books, this is pathetic. I don't know, most of her books are great, but really! Gillian is a weak character who is shallow enough to think that popularity is all that matters. David is boring and predictable, and I think Angel (or Gary) would have been much better for her. I wouldn't go for David because he acts all protective and stupid. Also, it makes the whole soulmate thing boring and not dangerous because the lost witch (Gillian) doesn't even know she is a witch at first. I think that LJS's other books are a lot better. ~Ondine	0
Hollywood reheats a classic, but this cheap serving is hardly very appetizing. This remake throws some heavy morsels of CGI down your throat and will give you indigestion.Same basic story, some people volunteer to stay in an extravagant mansion. This time they aren't told about the house's dark past. They believe they are part of a study on insomnia. The truth is they are part of a controlled experiment on group fear.Now I thought this was a nice alteration to the story. But unfortunately it starts to get extremely ridiculous. Nothing subtle here, there are plenty of cheap scares--like ghostly images or moving statues. As it turns out this house is basically a holding cell for dead children's souls. The evil landlord's spirit keeps watch over them in this purgatory. Great, a perverted pedaphile ghost.This turns into more of a goofy adventure flick. No spooky atmosphere or mystery. No suspense. No reason to bother.	0
I've had one of these printers for 6 months, and the paper feed problems have grown to the point where nothing will print without jams, feeding problems and more grey hairs. I spent 30 minutes online with HP's chat technician which were utterly worthless, and decided to return this today and get a new and different printer. I've had many printers in the past, and always been very happy with HP products before, but this one has been a disastor. There is apparently a paper feeder cleaning kit that HP will send that may or may not fix the problem, but after 30 minutes of trying to get the tech to send me one, I have given up on it! I have tried two different brands of good quality paper, and had the same problems with both. Buyer beware!	0
"To echo the sentiments of other reviewers, the orginal macabre illustrations were what made these books!, My highschool age son can't recall any of the stories but still talks about the ""super creepy"" pictures. Political correctness run amuck is the only explaination for the watering down of the imagery into something bland and banal. I truly hope the publisher reads these reviews if only to realize what a ridiculous decision changing the artwork was."	0
well i as well saw/heared the DVD playing at a local electronic store and was tempted to buy it.after the first time playing it i was dissapointed to find only a couple notes worthy of listenign to.after the 2nd round the dvd became old.the impressions looked fake and the energy everybodys talking about somehow didnt show on my DVD.to sum it up, i expected something new and exciting and i found an early 80`s like band playing on a cheap movie.not really recomended.	0
"This book lost all credibility when I read the authors' attack on fundamentalism. I am a former fundamentalist, so I might be expected to have an apostate's bias against fundamentalism, but these authors are not only inaccurate but almost comically biased. The authors claim that the fundamentalists' belief in the truth of the Bible is ""borders on idolatry,"" that fundamentalists are ""often parasitic"" and define themselves not by belief in their scriptures or truth, but by their opposition to ""other approaches."" Instead of examining the mainstream Christian fundamentalist beliefs, the authors simply define all fundamentists as having ""a totally closed world view,"" and damn all fundamentalists by guilt through supposed association with the Ayatollah Khomeini, David Koresh and the Taliban.Lastly, the title is misleading, especially when sold in secular stores, as mine was. The title would more accurately be, _A Liberal Christian Response to Philosophy_, instead of the current title."	0
The book starts out well, but the author's explanation of social evolution contradicts the biological evolution Hogan likewise promotes in this book. This story could have been good other than the author's scientific and semi-moralistic inserts. At some points I had the feeling that he was trying to rationalize his own beliefs by authoring them in the book almost separate from the story.	0
This is another great continuation of the Buffy series. If you have seen the film and the series that sprang from it then you will love this.Go out and buy it. I have and i don't regret it for a second, and neither will you!	1
DON'T BUY! NOT EVEN FOR A PENNY!! I'm a #1 No Doubt fan and this cd totally sucked!! I bought it because I thought I stumbled onto something rare. It has nothing to do with the band, just heresay and nothing at all interesting! an english lady reads it and there's no NO Doubt music at all. It wasn't even written by no doubt and it contains no real info just when their albums came out and what label. I buy EVERYthing that's no doubt and I wouldn't spend a dollar on it!!	0
Ohh come on, tell me, how many variations can he make when he hits the high pitches? 1? Put the lousy production of this album aside, he sings worse than an amateur. His voice is sonorous, but the only thing he's good at is to show it, without any feelings whatsoever. Analogy: a fish that doesn't know how to use its fins to swim.	0
Jack Dakota found out that he has a son from an eight year old liason. Dakota is a gamblin' man.Enter Hallie Ryan, a scruffy young woman, trying to save her ranch. She has debts from a gamblin' father and a seventeen year old brother trying to follow in daddy's footsteps.Dakota buys the ranch, Eden's Canyon, out from under Hallie. And being as how she knows more about ranching than Jack, he keeps her on to learn ropes.Not too much angst, but an attraction that keeps growing stronger despite the differences that should keep them apart.Hallie teaches Jack about the everyday running of a ranch and how to relate to his son, Ethan. Jack teaches Hallie to loosen up and enjoy some womanly pleasures and how to act in company.And little by little Hallie's brother, Ben changes for the better and slowly a family is melded together through their supportive trials.Definitely recommended - thoroughly enjoyable but ah well!	1

Out the blue one day, Venus goes to the beauty salon and instructs her stylist to cut her hair off then she sends her boyfriend on his way. Wonder what cause this? Venus is in search of her independence. This is an outstanding debut. God's Blessing's to the author.	1
If your studying herbs or medicinal plants this book should NOT be on your list of books to own. IT IS WORTHLESS! It is a Pagan Religion Book. Plain and simple! In my opinion it is for the study of WITCHCRAFT and the like.	0
The movie is superb. Putting it on DVD in full format is not. What a waste of $$$! If I pay for a DVD, I expect the letterbox format.	0
"These are wonderful postcards for any dog and/or animal lover. The photos are very well-done and the dogs are adorable.As the previous reviewer stated, the postcards are black and white pictures of dogs with a short bit of information on the back including the photographer, title and date of the photograph and a short bit of information on the dog in the photo.They are printed on thick 6"" x 6"" cardstock, which will make them durable in the mail (if you intend to mail them). However, it should be noted that at this size, the postcards mail at letter rate and not postcard rate."	1
Even though they don't leak, I hate the fact that the baby smells poop all the time. The diaper gets wet and then the baby and all his clothes smell terrible. Also I don't like them because they do not seem as natural on the baby's skin as the Huggies. Huggies are for sure a better option! I will never buy them again!	0
I read george orwells book 1984. I didnt really like this book due to the fact it was a total negative outlook throughout the whole book. His prediction of the future was a little to far fetched for me. That book wasnt really my style. I can see this book being liked by many people so I would recommend it due to the fact everyone has different opinions. This book being such a negative outlook of the future just wasnt what i wanted to read about.	0
i've bought this ring from Sabrina Silver twice now, and BOTH times I have been MORE than satisfied with both the speed of receipt as well as the high quality of her products. I highly recommend the product and the seller!	1
"This remixed soundtrack is great. Some DJ's techno, dance, and house is interwined into Yoko's music for a CD which will leave you dancing. I love how all of my fav. songs are remixed with so much emotion, and beat. Each song made me get up and dance with its kickin' grooves and modern day instruments. The begining portion is great, with that very uncanny remix of ""Theme of Aya"". The middle is the meat. This is when the new kicks out the old. Its amazing. And at the end, the CD is brilliantly closed with a rock/trance remix of everybody's favourite, ""Somnia Memorias""!"	1
"This DVD is a waste of money because of 2 things.1. DVD qualityThe quality is terribe. The color looks washed out. The film is grainy. Most of the time it's in zoom mode. So all I can see is the faces and shoulders of the actors even when they're dancing!2. The plot is boring.What a waste of money. The only good western film made in the 1960's is ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly"""	0
I am partial to the Familia Swiss brand for my museli, but this is my favorite crunchy style. I prefer to have the nuts in the mix and add my own fruit as seasonally available. Freeze dried fruit is just never as good.	1
I like Clay and bought the cd, but save your money and download the songs from the show, they are MUCH better. He is so good and this cd is so bad. What happened? Just a rush to get it out? You have the talent, just pick better songs next time.	0
I purchased this product to help eliminate my mild acne, and used it in conjunction with MDSkincare's cleanser/toner, and tinted moisturizer. I have 4 days left of my 30 day supply and have seen no improvement in my acne, or noticable improvement in overall skintone. Actually, I am now breaking out in places I've never had probelms with before. I will try Perricone products next, the MDScincare pads seemed to be a waste of $75 for me.	0
I have made investments before i was recommended to his book. I am a poor reader of books but i completed this book within 2 weeks. I have since make little notes on interesting articles. If one spend quality time in reading, you will learn more about investments and assessing businesses.	1
"Everyone should buy this album.It's the best album he ever recorded.The album is a must have cd for all true LL fans.All the tracks are slamin from start to finish.Like the title say ""Greatest Of All Time""."	1
I originally purchased the Metric edition, Celsius 232.778. I was thoroughly disappointed. Reading the original was a breath of fresh air, even if it wasn't as renown by the International Organization for Standardization.	1
This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!	0
"I decided to read ""Island"" because i enjoyed ""Brave New World"" so much. Well the former is really horrible compared to the latter. It's pretty boring, the plot doesn't make much sense and the main character's ideas are often all over the place.While certain parts of this story are interesting, in it's entirety, i would have to give it two thumbs down :("	0
Love this product. I wear it when I am doing my cardio to help with weight loss. It is true to size.	1
Paul Galdone captures the story just right with his wording and illustrations. This is a must-have for my grandchildren. You can't go wrong with a Paul Galdone illustrated folktale.	1
"My rating is not a reflection of the greatness of Cream, rather a forewarning to prospective buyers of this compilation. Before purchasing this compilation, consider that there is a vastly better one available for near the same price! ""The Very Best of Cream"" features all of the tracks presented ""Strange Brew"", an additional 8 tracks, and more extensive liner notes. Also ""The Very Best of Cream"", released in 1995, was the first Cream best of to be released exclusively on CD, and is mastered using Apogee's UV22 encoding that vastly improves the sound quality of the original songs, and the songs on this album. Save your money and get it instead!"	0
This was another one of those movies that mostly had it's special effects support it. Don't get me wrong Catherin Zeta-Jones was hot as usual but she needed a bigger role. This movie was good in many ways but not for horror like maybe adventure would have suited it fine but not horror. As a matter of fact I would like to take this opportunity to say that this movie is the least scariest that I have ever seen but still a good storyline goes behind it. So yes this movie would be worth renting.	0
Purchased this as a Kindle app, and really like the versatility of having a book of this nature on hand, literally.	1
Witch of Blackbird Pond By... Elizabeth George Spear The Witch of Blackbird Pond is a fantastic book! Elizabeth George Spear wrote it, and in my opinion she did a wonderful job of it too. I would recommened this book to any fourth or fifth grader. It is a wonderful mix of facts and romance. It is great for class read-alouds and something for the entire family to enjoy. It has won several Newberry awards. I would say it is a wonderful book for any class.	1
"This is a great MP3 player, and costs a lot less than an Apple equivalent. Shipping was fast. In case you want to sync some tracks from your computer to the Sansa View, connect it to your computer and call SanDisk support and they will ""activate"" the player remotely and you will be able to sync ever after. I downloaded to user manual. It is much more detailed than the skippy little guide that comes with the player. All in all I am very happy with this player."	1
Well, I only write reviews for things I dont like enough. Otherwise dont bother.I previously had a sansa and it worked great. I dropped and broke it. The best thing about sansa is Rhapsody on the go feature and the radio feature. Unlike say an iPod, I can just listen to all kinds of music for $14.99 or something.But this new one keeps giving me the wror message 'Your tracks are not synchronized'. I then have to deauthorize device and computer, re-authorize, re-format, restore factory settings, to get it to work. Mega pain in the behind.Dont know if the fault is with Rhapsody or with Sansa, but I am seriously looking for other options for my music.	0
it is a wonderful look at the traditions and history of goju ryu. A must for students of this art.	1
This item should come free with a Belkin OmniView. Seems amazon and sellers are deliberately selling separate to make more money by charging shipping and handling for an item that should ship with Belkin OmniView when a customer is purchasing one.	0
I bought this for my retirement/vacation home. I had 5 cup version using it every day and just recently order inside pot.	1
I am very disappointed in the blu-ray edition of this movie. This disk was made in Mexico. Itdoes not have the original picture ration. It is only 1:49 I owned this movie on DVD beforeI purchased it in blu-ray. The DVD has retained the original movie display. I will probablytry to find someone who doesn't mind but I won't watch it.	0
Having used Pampers for the last year and been very happy with them I was more than shocked when this last box arrived and the absorbency pad was half as thick as it used to be. Needless to say - my son can't even make it through a nap without soaking through his diaper let alone the night time. I am now switching to Huggies in hopes of not having to get up at 3am to changed a sopping wet, screaming child.	0
"The majority of the songs on this album are very poorly written; borderline cheesy.Although Clay's voice has improved even further since winning runner up on American Idol, these songs do not do his voice justice.""Invisible"" is the strongest song on the album and is very catchy, but the album just nose dives after the 1st song.Being a huge fan of American Idol, I am extremely disappointed in Clay's debut album. His sales may end up being higher than Kelly Clarkson's or Justin Guarini's, but out of the 3, I'd have to say that Kelly is still American Idol's golden child.I'll pass Clay's cd onto someone else and keep Kelly's in my cd player. Too bad that Clay didn't receive the same quality of songs as Kelly did. Now I can only cross my fingers and hope that Ruben & Tamyra will not have an album full of poorly written songs like Clay and Justin have."	0
This movie is full of a bunch of slow moving character developments. There's a bunch of long dialogues between men and women that are very drab and superficial. People tell me to watch this film for the amazing jump cut edits...well I did and big deal. Let's face it this guy is no Scorcese when it comes to doing innovative stuff with the camera, writing compelling scripts, and getting a likable cast up on the screen. Personally I think this guy just writes films for film school types and completely ignore us the audience.	0
I liked this book , the story was interesting and it showed different sides of American culture from the eyes of an immigrant farm worker.	1
"First of, if your looking for cheap ""blood and gore"" zombie thrills, don't even finish reading this review. However, if you're looking for a griping story that focuses on the human condition in the aftermath of a global catastrophe, you've to the right place. David Moody is rising star in this genre, and if you read this book, you'll see why. The accurate portrayals of ordinariy people in this crisis is shockingly real. While the British spelling of some words may throw a few readers off, this book is fresh take on a worn out genre.Spread the infection."	1
"How much worse can bad pop music get? Clay Aiken worse! This CD reminds me why I stopped listening to top 40 radio 10 years ago. ""Measure of a Man"" is proof that you can put nothing in a box, wrap it in pretty teenybopper wrapping, call it ""great"" and people will come running to buy it. Look, this nondescript, manufactured creature's CD has generated over 2000 reviews so far. Wow, alot of fools are buying this nonsense.YOU ARE SLAVES, WAKE UP!Every Brittany (Her initials are ""B.S."" How obvious can you get?), Christina and Clay CD that you purchase pushes REAL music further and further out of the public's reach. Start reversing this trend by not purchasing this garbage."	0
"I had purchased Cirrus' second album first (Back on a Mission) and it really appealed to a broad electronic audience, but Drop the Break is probably more for pure ""electronic heads."" This album is mostly big beat songs with electronic remixes and some interesting live elements. However, amidst all the big beat and electronic songs, 'October 27' stands out as a truly beautiful slow-er song. It almost reminds me of some of BT's work. I hope I never get tired of hearing that track.The big picture: The Cirrus boys have alot of talent and if you like their music stlyes or big beat/dance/electronic music then this is a must have for your collection. Happy Gooves...."	1
Worked great for only a short time. Remote stopped working- called (not even an 800 number) and e-mailed Mega-tech - NO RESPONSE Wasted our money on this garbage!	0
Emily Bransbury's mom just died a week ago,her best friends mom was arrested for haelping the assasanation of Aberaham Lincoln. Now she needs to live with her Uncle Valentine. But when Emily finds out about his night life she puts her and her uncle in danger.My opinion is that it was to long for me. After a week of reading it I was sick of it. Plus it was way to slow.I wouldnt reccomend this book because in some spots its hard to tell whats happening. Plus it is long enough you may not want to read the end.I would say its a good book for book clubs. You could help each other with the confusing stuff, and with the words. For people my age i read it a long time in advance.	0
"To me this was the beginning of the end for the Wilson sisters. Sure, there are some okay songs on here, or so I thought until I recently replaced my vinyl LP with the CD. These songs sound so dated that I can't believe I used to like them. To put it mildly, this album was Heart's contribution to the 1980s ""hair band"" movement. Synthesizers and drum machines have taken over for Nancy and Howard's guitar playing. Dreamboat Anne and Little Queen still sound as good today as they did when they were released. This CD does not."	0
I Love Gloria and thought this was an album featuring both artists together instead u get six tracks of staney then six of Gloria not together at all and all very badly re issued on cd please dont waste your money as I did	0
I got these as a gift and really do like them. I just stick them to the fridge (magnets) and always know where they are. They are easy to use altho I do find they release less salt or pepper than you first think....so you have to squeeze more times than you normally would. It takes some getting used to.This is very handy to have, easy to use and its nice to have a small set to pass around at the table. I am also glad you can graind the salt...some sets are for grinding pepper but not the salt.	1
I've reviewed a couple of other Waechtersbach items, and I'm quite happy with these as well! I have only two minor complaints. First, on these, the glaze seems to be scratching (utensils?) more than the other Waechtersbach products I have...my plates and cereal bowls aren't doing that. Second, all four of them had a funny little bump on the outside rim...it looked identical on all four. Maybe a slight manufacturing defect? The glaze is slightly darker around the bump, so you can see it, though it's not overly obvious. But overall I love them - they're great for soups and pasta (spaghetti especially). They're holding up quite well in the dishwasher, too - no chips or cracks, despite how they sort of lean against one another. Very pleased!	1
I had no idea what to expect going into this film (just watched it on DVD a few minutes ago). I had heard some negativity from fans of the comic (I've never read the comic myself); and it certainly had the potential to be a flop. But I absolutely loved it! The plot was interesting, the acting was good, the effects were great -- and there was not a boring moment. What could have been a hack, predictable plot was always surprising and interesting. Hats off to the writers and director -- with all the crap horror/thriller that gets on the big screen, this was a welcome change.	1
I purchased the Radeon 7000 and found that it was not supported by Madden 2003, so I went to replace it with one that was and found out that the ATI software was everywhere on my hard drive. ATI makes it impossible to remove the programs. I ended up having to format the whole hard drive!! I would not recommend this product to anyone.	0
This picture book has very colorful photos of our country and our fellow citizens. The pages are spread by the breaks in text that we know from reciting the pledge orally at school. Children are from different races. Scenes from all over America and even an astronaut on the moon holding the American flag are depicted.In the back there are small photos that were depicted in the book with explanations about where they are and other factual information to explain the contents of the photographs. The entire pledge is rewritten in the back pages and an explanation of who wrote it, why, and when. The meaning of why we recite the pledge is given. Facts about the American flag's changes over the years and facts about the proper way to display a flag, and on what days, are included.A beautiful book with great information that every child should be exposed to.	1
I can summarize why I didn't like this movie pretty quickly. It was long and boring, and the antichrist wasn't born until about the end of the movie, and then it was over. Nothing really interesting really happened. I felt like it was a waste of time. If you want a good movie about the incarnation of the antichrist, what The Omen, it's much more worth the time.	0
"Really dumb Keanu Reeves film that has him fighting the underworld and dying of lung cancer at the same time. Keanu Reeves is Keanu Reeves, don't expect much emotion from him or for that matter much acting ability either. Rachel Weisz on the other hand does deliver the goods with her very good performance but she's literally alone in the good acting department while she is surrounded by actors who are more in tuned with Keanu's style of acting. This movie rip off a movie called ""The Prophecy"" and it does it so blatantly that it even steals its climax.I suggest you rent that movie instead."	0
"I saw this film last night after refusing to see it for a while because of a fear of ventriloquism. What a great film! I sincerely believe that this is Anthony's Hopkins finest performance. His telepathic card scene with Ann Margaret is fantastic, he is just so intense. This is one of the most intelligent horror movies I've ever seen, because Fats never walks around on his own, when he murders victims, its done by Corky. Corky's obsession with perfection and success ultimately takes over his mind and ability to control himself. Metallica once did a song about this film called ""Sad but True,"" it sums up the ideology of this film well. I also believe this film's concept may have been based on that one Twilight Zone episode, but I could be mistaken."	1

"Like many others, I picked up this book hoping to get a kernel or two of wisdom on how to consult to those at the top of the leadership pyramid. What I got was disappointing, to say the least. At minimum, this book is mistitled, because the reader is led to expect a comprehensive description about how executive teams function and create the same kind of magic we find with teams elsewhere in the organization. Instead, we are treated to page after page of exhortation, warning against a) calling an executive team a ""real team""; b) encouraging CEOs to create ""real"" executive ""teams"" and c) permitting ""undisciplined"" teamwork at the top, lest senior executives suddenly drink the kumbya-flavored Kool-Aid of too much collaborative behavior. There is little of value in this lightly-referenced and illogically-written tome. This is not the book to take on a long plane trip as your only reading, unless you are a big fan of command and control leadership styles."	0
This book is misleading. Contains impressive amount of errors, that leads readers to learn wrong concepts. I am starting to doubt that this book was written by a Phd. Or if it was, then lets revoke his title. Hope they release some decent review on this.	0
after baby #2 I knew I wanted to try binding as a form of getting my tummy back as soon as possible. I am so glad that I bought the squeem, it really does cinch your waist giving you an unreal hourglass shape. I began wearing mine 1 week postpartum and people just couldn't believe that I had just had a baby. Now that I am 7 months postpartum, I wear mine to the gym for extra back and abdominal support. It has really helped give me my old shape back and even seems to have nipped in my waist more than it was before!	1
Very easy to use. The cooked rice is delicious. The only problem is that it cooks very slow.	1
Once again, Sandra Lee is out to poison America with her high-sodium, preservative-laden recipes. This book is a joke. Under no circumstances should anyone who prefers not to die before the age of 45 should buy this. Heart attack city! Oh, and crappy food. Did I mention how bad her recipes are? Terrible. The scourge must be stopped! Whoot!	0
Great deal!! They arrived in less time than quoted to my door! You just can't go wrong with Pampers and I am loving Amazon!! :)	1
Oasis dogged it on this album.... Be Here Now and Dya Know What I Mean are the only 2 songs on here that don't drive you mad. It's still a fun album to own for like a month, but after that it will collect dust. I don't know what it is about Oasis, but their songs just tire very easily, unlike the songs of say, U2. Anyway I'm sure the next album will be great again. Yeah Yeah Yeah.	0
This is an amazing DVD. Myself and 4 other friends worked out together and we had so much fun. We all had to sweat and enjoyed the pain the day after!

I think people read Alan Dean Foster because they know what they will get. The writing is clear and clean, the story imaginative, and nothing is very challenging. Something to read just for pleasure if you don't want to be doing something else.	1
Considering the richness of the subject matter and the real life stories of those who lived it this was a truly bad movie. The makers tried to tell everything and as a result told nothing. The characters were unbelieveably superficial and too many of the flying scenes were historically inaccurate and unreal. If a few special effects are good too many are not necessarly better. The Blue Max and Battle of Britain are far far superior. For those who are willing to put up with a mess just to look at recreations of old airplanes its probably worth buying but be prepared for alot of dissapointment if you are looking for a good movie.	0
We plugged this on only to have it spark and not power our ibook G4. It went back the next day.	0
ok product if you only need it for a year or so. Mine stopped working and will not power on. Many similar complaints online.	0
This movie is extremely boring. It is not scary at all. I haven't seen House on Haunted Hill but it can't possibly be as bad as this. Don't get it.	0
What is it where a director has so little confidence in his own work, that he has to fill in whatever blanks he perceives with incessant music?? I mean, it is non-stop music throughout almost all the movie. When you find yourself fastforwarding to get to the meat of the story, you know you have a loser.	0
Initially I began reading Candide to prepare for an in class argument about theodicy and the existence of God. I thoroughly enjoyed this novel. It's funny and tragic all at the same time while reflecting how total optimism is truly naivety. People wondering how this book pertains to the present time, just look around. War, rape, murders, famine, suffering of innocents, disease... Voltaire reflects all those things in his work. For someone to say Candide has nothing to do with society today shows they are being blindly optomistic. Candide is great and thought provoking.	1
The quality of this video is exceptionaly poor. Our 2.5 year old seems to love it but it makes me want to tear my eyes out. The voice of the main character sounds like a robot and is very annoying. I would look else where for a piano DVD.	0
This book is fascinating for anyone at all interested in New Zealand history or a general account of life in the past. It is surprisingly well written for what is just a series of letters, and gives a real insight into life as a pioneer in the 1860s, with all its highs and lows. You'll laugh at the author's first attempts at baking, and cry with her as she digs dead lambs from a snowdrift. It's a wonderful book and I heartily recommend it.	1
Bought this card to use with an iPod, and was greatly disappointed. My new iPod only comes with a cable to connect to USB 2.0 ports, and the USB ports on this card DO NOT WORK with iPods. I had to go buy an additional cable (iPod to Firewire) in order to get my iPod working. The Firewire ports on this card DO work with an iPod, but you'll need a Firewire cable that new iPods may not give you.	0
This is a generic, cheesy yoga video with plenty of 'namaste' B.S. to go around. The poses are fine and good, but the video doesn't really offer up any yoga that is different and specific to surfing. Maybe that's because yoga in general is just good for surfing, I don't know ... but I was expecting more.Save your money and just go to a real class.	0
"I must admit that I'm addicted to ""Version 2.0."" The entire CD is listenable -- not one track gets skipped on my CD player. Described by Shirley Manson herself as ""mongrel-esque,"" the band's style is a unique compendium of diverse musical genres. The result is a tight, masterfully-crafted audio experience. Pure listening enjoyment."	1
I wonder if only the good reviews get notice or do the people who don't care for it much take the time to comment on it. Not worth the effort,couldn't finish it.	0
The bible comimg to life is what happens when you read this book and with that you remember it more clearly and can identify with the characters.I can't wait to start on #2. Lynn Austin is remarkable in her writing in that it takes you right to where they are at.	1
"This is a collection of Forsyth's short stories. They are thrillers with political background to some extent. They sometimes have some comical scenes as well. I like 'The Emperor', because I think it's a twisted version of ""The Old Man and the Sea""."	1
I got these last December-05. The molded plastic that holds the ear cups onto the headband started to crack (right at the L/R labels). They eventually crumbled and fractured, causing the cups to fall off. I taped one side up and the other failed as well. I have no doubt that if I replace these, the same thing will happen. My complaint is for $300 I expect something other than soft plastic holding these together at the stress points.	0
first this was 2 separate cd's a good way for nelly to make money since nelly can't come up with new song ideas he decided to put the best songs on both albums and combine them and call it sweatsuit boy nelly you sure are a jackass for doing this good matrketing skills every song on here sucks just like sweat and suit did nelly fell off after country grammar he lost his edge doing songs with pisstina aguilera and even tim mcgraw's weak ass you gonna do country keep it hood idiot.	0
We've been very happy with our purchase. Not only were these diapers a great value compared to what it would have cost to purchase them at a local retailer, but they've also worked very well for our daughter. We've gone through about half of them, and only 1-2 have actually leaked. They do a great job containing messes, and seem to be very comfortable. We used Huggies for our older son, and at this point, these are holding up just as well (for less)!	1
A good one... and a few more words to fill out my review. I'd like to be able to just rate movies and shows without having to do this... someday.	1
This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play.	1
I prefer the Pampers Swaddler, It was my mistake I got the wrong kind but had already placed my order and didnt realize that they weren't swaddler. Gave my poor baby a rash. These diapers are too thin for my baby. Not pleased at all	0
I wanted this to use for tea when I'm away from home and it doesn't get hot enough, not even tepid.	0
Beware, although this is advertised an an indoor/outdoor antenna, it is not. It is INDOOR ONLY. So I ended up returning the item and by the time I paid the shipping BOTH directions, I was within $15 of what the antenna cost!!!DO NOT BUY THIS IF YOU NEED AN OUTDOOR ANTENNA	0
I was sick of the constant cycling my cheap programmable thermostat was doing. It would cycle my furnace and A/C every 5 to 10 minutes regardless if it needed it. This one let's you adjust that cycle temperature. I adjusted it so now it can have up to +/-2.5 degree F swing. So if you set 65 it will kick on at 63 and shut off at 67. It can be adjusted so it stays at a constant temperature as well, but I was trying to get rid of the constant cycling during cold weather. Great product so far.	1
I bought this because my crappy D-link wireless pci adapter was dying only after about 6 months into use. It was dropping connections every 10 minutes or so. Now after I plug this in, I get at least 4 bars compared to average 2-3 bars i used to get with d-link. I saw some users complain about the short antenna. Yes it is pretty short but long enough to get on top of the computer and that alone can make whole lot of difference. Otherwise spend little more money and get more expensive ones. For this price, this one is a steal. Also to anyone who bought/will buy this item. Do yourself a favor, dont use the crappy driver that comes with it. Go to ralink website and download their reference driver.	1
If you liked Stargate SG-1, Stargate Atlantis, or Stargate: The Ark of Truth. Then you will most likely enjoy this film. The plot was... different. I enjoyed it but it seemed to go by fast.Stars: *****	1
"When I purchased this book, I had completely forgotten that I had read ""Deja Dead"" two years before. It took 3 weeks to plough through this slow moving novel and I was tempted several times to just put it away. Her knowledge of forensics is commendable (she is an expert after all), but her knowledge of how to utilize plot and character needs much improvement. Needless to say, that is an art form of its own."	0
With no harmful intentions toward the movie brassed off.(thats where the talk at the begining of the song tubthumpin came from)Thank God I don't have any guns. Otherwise I wouldn't be here to write this review. What is this bait and switch. I first heard tubthumping on the radio very most excellent. Or so I thought. I bought the CD hoping for some good British tunes and what did i get. Stuff the baby on the cover could have written better. Please save shelve space never make another CD in this genre.	0
I signed up with subscribe and save and receive a case of pampers every 2 months or more frequently. When i signed up i thought i was locking in my rate at the price given then and did notice that it fluctuated by a minimal amount. Now when i received my order once again i was disappointed to notice that the price went up a lot about $10 since I started ordering here. By now the price in not so cheap and i may buy elsewhere.	0
"""I have never told this story nor shall mortal man see this manuscript until I have passed over for eternity. I know that the average human mind will not believe what it can not grasp......""Written in 1912 this book is well written for its time and has intrigued countless generations of readers. I get the feeling that this story is being told over a campfire.Captain Carter is telling the story form memory as an old man of his adventures here on earth and on the planet of Barsoom (Mars).

Be careful when putting these together. Start with the base and go upwards with the rest of the bowls. These bowls are smaller than my cereal bowls and the big base is very shallow. Not worth it!	0
This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children.	1
"Despite this movie's impressive pedigree (classic novel, classic sixties horror film) ""The Haunting"" manages to foul the entire story up with dreadfully over-the-top special effects and a contrived, ridiculous story. Roots aside, this movie in its own right is poorly crafted and uniteresting. Special effects buffs may enjoy it, but wouldn't they enjoy a well thought out story laced with intelligence and wit better?"	0
"My girlfriend told me I had to see this movie, that I would love the ""eye candy"". She was right; I could spend much more time watching these girls dance around. But in addition to all that, it ends up being a very entertaining movie - fun characters, fun story, fun music."	1
I was so looking forward to Tomb Raider: AOD coming out in November 15th 2002. Then it got delayed, then delayed again, and again, and again, and again. When it finally came out (8 MONTHS LATER) I was really excited. I put the game in my PS2. And was really shocked at how bad this game was. I was expecting something incredible. But no. Lara moves like a robot, it is very difficult to control her, loads of bugs and its boring. No fun. I am a huge Tomb Raider fan and have played them all. But I think this one might be making a trip back to the shop for a refund. However, the graphics are incredible (best i've seen in any game), lara looks amazing and the music is great. But overall I am very dissapointed. EIDOS, get it right next time.	0
The book was wonderful and in good condition. I purchased it for my daughter, who is in highschool. The book arrived around the time it stated it would. Above all of that the price was great.	1
Forget what the naysayers reviewed. It brought me back to my childhood. I thought it had a good enough plot. Action was outstanding, and Optimus Prime's voice is the same as when I was a kid some 25 years ago. Those bits of nostalgia coupled with modern day CGI fulfilled this geek. And what were you expecting Shindler's List? L.A. Confidential? The first time you saw Sixth Sense? It's mindless fun and this fanboy was all for it.	1
"The author is smart. If you name a book, ""Nappily Ever After"" you're gonna trick hair conscious women (which is practically every woman) into reading your novel. But is it really about hair?The basis is about hair but the message the author is trying to convey is about finding who you are and being comfortable with that. The author is a very good writer and storyteller. She took a very basic idea and made it into a very entertaining story with a lesson. A lot of people can't do that very well. It's just a simple lesson that most women can relate too. Nothing deep or philosophical (we have Octavia Butler for that) but a lesson about being comfortable with who you are.I give it 4 stars: It's a nice story.... good airplane read, poolside read, whatever. I just don't care for the characters that much. Kandi and Clint are really mean."	1
Bought version 2.0 of this at a local bricks & mortar retailer. I couldn't get the software on disc 1 to work. Exchanged the disc - tried it on a few different computers but no luck, so I'm shopping for something else now.	0
RoboCop 3 was a show I strongly anticipated. I expected a continuation of Robo 2: The evil mistress in prison possibly teaming up with a revived Clarence Boddicker from Robo 1. They somehow get out and terrorize Detroit. Who knows? Could be far fetched but I thought the ending of 2 was a good setup for 3. Instead, we've got a boring bad guy with an English accent and a show with nothing I could find to get interested in. The diabolic, sinister Boddicker in 1 and Cain in 2 are replaced by some bad guy wanna be. I even gave my #3 away its so bad.	0
Like every other Mac user, I think the replacement power cord with the bulky, cumbersome block is overpriced and less than durable, so I decided to outsource. What I got was never quite up to speed, but since my laptop mostly stays plugged in, the quick charge wasn't a must. Unfortunately, after a scant 8 months, with very little movement or unplugging (I've packed up my laptop for travel exactly twice in that time), the power cord has given out. There seems to be a short between the wires, with the hazardous side effect of causing random sparking at the connection between the computer plug-in and the wire. Needless to say, I'm not going back to this product!	0
Of course not. And this is another great one. Just stop putzing around and buy it.	1
With the holidays coming, I knew I would have even less time and even more to do than usual so when I saw this book I knew it was just what I needed. Some of the recipes are fairly basic, like the lasagna, but there are other more exotic dishes that I can't wait to try, the shangra la lobster being one. I tested some of the appetizer and dessert recipes for holiday parties and they were easy easy easy and looked and tasted amazing. This is a terrific resource for the holidays and all year.	1
What a GREAT cd!!! I love listening to Clay over and over and over again!! WOW!!! Great job!!!! Thank you so much for making this cd!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	1
These boots have that classic hiking boot style to them. The NuBuck leather looks great and the boots are comfortable and seem well made. I'm not really a hiker. I just like to wear hiking boots in the winter and these are perfect so far. I wear them everyday and I like them so much, I was thinking of ordering another pair!	1
This book has changed my vision of natural human nature. I have found many events and characteristics of the Party to be preshadowings of organizations I see everyday. It also showed me how an evil administration can distroy a love that was so strong. This book is scary and too real.	1
Ostebee and Zorn presented Calculus in a mind stimulating and reform way. No more copying examples out of the book because every problem is the same. This book makes you discover the methods and understanding. The basic understandings are provided, but the rest is up to you! I have never understood Calculus so thoroughly! I do not rate the book five stars, because of the unreliable solutions manual. The book is geared toward user discovery, so the solutions in the manual need to be CORRECT in order for the user to benefit the most.	1
I bought the system with the amplifier to run from one building to another (250 feet). It worked fine in the building the transmitter was located, but the quality completely fell apart once I crossed into the second building. I saw a forum where someone recommended a different high-gain antenna and tried contacting the company for suggestions for over a week with zero response. The tech support voice mailbox was full, the operator never answered the phone and I left repeated messages there. I tried e-mailing and calling every department I could locate. Half the phone numbers were disconnected and no response on the e-mails either.The product might have worked fine if I had a little tech support from the company. But as it stands I'm going on the assumption that RF-Link has gone out of business and so I'm returning my purchase.	0
Very fast connection workS great while watching netflix and youtube videos on tivo. I was told by a friend that its better to use hard wire than wireless but this couldn't be farther from the truth. This works great and I haven't had any problems with the speed. I would recomind this for anyone who has a tivo.	1
I bought this book based on a firend's advice, who claimed that it was the best book he had ever read. Well, the first page was very interesting and captivating, and then I started suffering through the rest. A never ending, boring, slow, and confusing book. It took me almost a year to finish it and I suffred through every page. What is all the fuss? I didn't find it intelectually challenging, entertaining, or fun to raed. It was just boring and confusing, pure and simple.	0
This stuff really helps improve your CM if you need a little help in that area. I'm on Clomid which unfortunately dries you out and I had heard of EPO on a forum I frequent. I took one pill with my mother meds after dinner and could already see an improvement by that night. The next day my CM was creamy, and without the EPO I would have been dry or sticky at best. By the third day I was borderline wet/creamy. I'm only on CD6 now and didn't ovulate until CD20 last cycle so I imagine by the time I need fertile CM it won't be an issue.	1
If you don't like Kenneth Copeland, then please don't write dumb, childish reviews that have nothing to do with the product. I just had to say it. The other reviews on this CD are purely based on their personal distaste for the man behind the songs, which is not how one rightly rates a product. ANYWAY, this CD is great fun to listen to imo, whether you like/know who Kenneth Copeland is or not. Jazzy takes on favorite Christmas songs like 'Go Tell It On The Mountain' and 'Away In A Manger' make their debut here, and they're great fun to listen to. This CD has been a part of my family's Christmases since it was released in 2004, and will continue to be. Why? Because the music is good and it gets you in the spirit of Christmas, that's why! Highly recommend this product.	1
"... that Oprah chose this book for her Book Club. Because, you know, that Nobel Prize endorsement is just so overdone. (Does anyone know if she has reviewed the Bible yet? the Torah, perhaps?)As a fan of 'stream of consciousness' (or to quote a fellow poster, ""rambling'), I actually enjoyed GGM's style. It was a struggle at times, though. But I would recommend it to anyone wanting to expand their streams of consciousness. I suppose if anything positive may be said about the Oprah Book Club, it's that it at least encourages people to read GGM's work."	1
I was pretty disappointed with this CD, and don't think I'll be buying another Musiq CD because he seems to be going downhill. He's basically regurgitating the first two projects with not very much success. I really like Musiq's whole vibe, hopefully it's not too late for the brother to pick it back up again.	0
I useally buying dipers from amazon.com. However, the dipers on this box are looks like old. Also, I can see the brown spots on the surface. I really want to return it, but I already opened and used some. Check your diper all the time!!	0
Wow, I just bought this CD and I was surprised to see how poorly reviewed it was. Actually, that is the primary reason for my participation in this review... to offer a positive and encouraging reason to purchase this compact disc. I found the music to be refreshing and beautiful and, despite what other reviews have said, found the musicians to be quite talented. It's a good CD to relax to, have a dinner party to, et cetera. It's not REM, don't expect to hear REM. It is, however, a string quartet who brings a refreshing twist to most of REM's popular songs.	1
"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."	0
What a couple of great old movies. Bing Crosby and Fred Astaire are always great together. Good music and dancing.	1
this movie was the longest...boring movie i have ever seen. i didn't think he could ever do a horrible movie till this one. the whole movie shows him getting high and going on trips and setting people up for his mistakes...its a bunch of crap! maybe it would be good for someone that is really stoned out of their mind to sit down in watch.	0
although there is actually only one hit on this CD, if youre from this time the memories are worth it all.	1
I have used this product for two weeks and wasted so many band aids. There is so little improvement that it is not worth buying this product. BEWARE	0
I'm sorry, but these are horrible for teaching belly dance. Atea is very stiff & stilted & her chorus dancers CANNOT dance! It is absolutely Scary!I have never seen anyone (in person or in a video) dance the way that they do in this video. If you are interested in learning to dance, please, choose another instructor!	0
"Though some of the works here are better than others, such as ""Milagro"", and ""The Integral"", Ms. Pita offers enough of a variety with a master's stroke that most tastes will be satisfied."	1
TAFFY OF TORPEDO JUNCTION is about a 13 year old girl who lives on the Outer Banks off the N.C. coast during World War II. This book was exciting and easy to read. I would recommend this book to a friend because it gives the reader a chance to see how rough it was to live during a war. Taffy uncovers a group of German spies living on Hatteras and reveals their location.	1
"i heard the song ""pda"" by interpol a couple of years back and it brought me back to this disk. such an amazing sound. this was their best cd and is some of the best of the late eighties and early nineties. they recorded this disc at a little island studio and it's as if they somehow transferred the vacation attitude into the music. it's difficult to explain it except to say the songs on this disc build an incrediclby wonderful mood and just seem to flow one to the next. it's like the best of the Catherine Wheel and the best Lush mixed together - great guitar, atomospheric and solid song writing. a totally enjoyable musical experience that stands the test of time."	1
We had signed up for a live childbirth class but then I was put on bed rest and unable to attend. This DVD was absolutely fantastic for us. It is packed full of useful information and actually quite entertaining. I would highly recommend this DVD as a great alternative to a live class.	1
"""afterglow"" is just another example of fine craftsmanship and pure pop hook laden melodies.i personally find versus one of the most inspiring bands i've ever heard. go see them live, you won't be dissapointed"	1
As entertaining as it is brilliant!!!! This is a masterful addition to your collection whether your a scientist or a sports hero. This is a work of brilliance you must see!!! Get the book too.	1
I dozed off part way through the film and then after watching another ten minutes just turned off the DVD player. The film seems to be aiming to be a comedy, but fails utterly. It can not be anything else except for a very weak (dark) comedy.	0
There are only 8 out of about 24 episodes from the Baking With Julia series on the DVD. Amazon would not guarantee me a full refund if I returned it since I took off the plastic.Even though I had not viewed it. I didn't notice that it was only 8 episodes till after a tore the plastic off and looked at the back of the dvd. Definitely is not work the money.	0
'Coyote Ugly' often gets compared to 'Flashdance'and sort of falls in the same genre, but it lacks both the charme and the choreography that made 'Flashdance' a success. It is hard to blame the actors for the failure to maintain the audience's interest, they simply didn't have anything to work with. The plot is entirely predicable, and all the characters (how did they do that?) remain without any depth. As a result, the different plots running through this feature appear strangely unrelated, maybe because as a viewer one just doesn't get engaged. Easily one of the worst offerings in the last 12 months, maybe ever.	0
I was looking for a simple way to park my new Bianchi roadie and thought this may do the trick- it did. Extremely well made (for a BB stand) with a non-marring coating anywhere the stand touches the frame. Picks the back wheel up far enough to easily make drivetrain adjustments as well as remove the rear wheel.Best stand at nearly any price- but for under $10	1
The only value in the cd is Sting and it is only one song.Spend your money on something else or buy a whole cd of sting, not justy one song.You will be glad you did.	0
The classic 1955 telecast - look forward to watching the whole DVD - am involved with a local production so looking @ the DVD for help with this - looks good.	1
I read this book ages ago, and since I can remember it's been considered a masterpiece worldwide. It seems like in some places a celebrity's blessing is needed to get the attention of those who instead of reading good literature are connected to the television watching crappy stuff. Well, if you fit the glove, then don't even bother leaving a review, carry on watching your stuff and leave the reviews for the ones who really enjoy good literature.	1
"This book is typical Keel--chock-full of anecdotes, skewed information, speculation, hoaxes (many of Keel's ""weird"" experiences in the case were jokes perpetrated by Gray Barker)--all presented as factual reporting.""Mothman"" does not exist. Several writers--most notably Joe Nickell--have thoroughly debunked the incident. But true facts have never stopped Keel.I'm a fan of Keel's writings, but you have to take them with a grain of salt. This is not one of his best efforts, and it rankles me that he positions himself as a serious journalist."	0
I randomly picked up this book while down with the flu and ended up reading the whole trilogy over three days. It truly kept me entertained and interested.I am not Irish and know little about Celtic lore, so some areas didn't excite me as much as other reviewers mentioning interest for the particular history. And while the story line and tale was enough to keep me reading straight through, it isn't the most amazing writing I've come a across4 stars = definitely worth a read!	1
My 5 year old twin boys have just begun to enjoy this series of books after reading two of the Billy and Blaze books saved from my own childhood. I decided to complete the collection for them and have bought all the other books. These classic boy-and-faithful-horse-adventure stories have a timeless appeal that have been a joy to revisit for me and to discover for the first time for them.	1
I enjoyed the movie, the only complaint I have is.......please let O'neill and Carter get together....at last! They have come so close and still are bound by military regulations.	1
Maybe I expected too much from this book. I thought this book could give me more insight into the dangers of statistical interpretations or the wrongful use of statistics. This book didn't help me at all with that. It's all very (very) basic stuff people should watch out for, when using statistics. Most of this I already knew. I think for anybody who has already red a book from Nicholas Taleb (or anything alike) this book will not present any new material.To people completely new to statistics, this book might be helpfull, but to those who frequently use statistics for their jobs or in their free time, this book won't add any value. There are much better books on statistics out there.	0
Nicolas Cage, Cher and Danny Aiello are involved in a strange 3 way love affair. Two brothers who do not speak to eachother fall for the same woman. Set in modern day Brooklyn, this story of lust and love is surrounded with the Italian/American flavor that is the thread of Danny Aiello's best film work. Throw in Olympia Dukakis as Cher's ugatza mother, and Vincent Gardenia as Cher's Sfachima father, and funny things happen. Add a star if you're from Brooklyn, add 2 stars if you're Italian. An Oscar winning 1980's comedy/romance!	1
"This is one of the ""final four"" - the four albums recorded by Lightfoot which had not, until now, been released on CD by Warner Brothers. (This has been released with Old Dan's Records, which is also very good.) I had Dream Street Rose on vinyl and so listening to it once again, this time on CD, is like seeing an old friend for the first time in a long time.It's typical Lightfoot, with his usual blend of simple melodies, lyrics about bittersweet love and, refreshingly, a brilliant version of the Auctioneer - all sung in his wonderful baritone voice. He's on good form, as are his usual backing musicians - Terry Clements, Rick Haynes and Pee Wee Charles.If you like Lightfoot, go buy this and the other members of the ""final four"" - well worth the money. Incidentally, if you're in the UK, they have not been released yet - am I the only UK resident with these on CD....?"	1
So far I'm very happy with my boots.They fit well and seem very well constructed.Time wiill tell how they perform but so far so good.	1
Well another one of my first dvd purchases...I found this concert very poor...it did nothing for me... the sound quality was poor, The set on stage was quite good but lacked the final sparkle, Janet's performance was glitzy... but sadly something was missing...my advice is puchase Janet's later DVDS...	0
I have two main complaints:1. These are not as absorbant as the pampers swaddlers, and since it's a diaper, that's pretty much its main task. I didn't experience any liquid leakage, but solids were problematic. Any more detailed description will probably prevent this review from being published...2. These diapers do not have the wetness indicator lines that are found on the swaddlers. I didn't realize that those lines were so useful until I subscribed to these (used to get them at Target).Anyway, these two reasons are sufficient for me to cancel my subscription after two shipments.This review is by no means related to Amazon's subscription and shipping service. I think Amazon does a fantastic job with that. All shipments arrived before the stated arrival dates with no problems at all!	0
I recently started commuting to work via bicycle. The only route I can take is quite busy, so I started out by riding on the sidewalks and nervously dodging all the cars turning right in front of me. The sidewalks were covered in trash and debris, and I had to maneuver around pedestrians too. After reading Effective Cycling, I ride in the street, with more confidence and fewer problems, and I arrive at work much faster. I highly recommend Effective Cycling for anyone who regularly rides his/her bike in an urban setting or wishes to.	1
"""Out door, keel cooling vorsnevou."" You could add this sentence to this mass of drivel and no one would know it wasn't written by Joyce. If the point of this book is the utter incomprehensibility of mankind, Joyce greatly contributes to it with this rambling waste of paper. A monkey and a typewriter could have written this ""experimental"" trash. I cannot see any way in which this ""work"" is a classic. It is stream of conscience gibberish. Anyone could have done it."	0
This was actually the 3nd of the Night Worlds I had ever read but I have a different cover and it says Enchantress why???? This was a good book and I liked the spells and particularely Blaise's necklace that was cool.I wonder if yemonja really exists and the other spices.It is true that most of LJSmith's books are with witches and vampires and that we don't know what shapeshifters shape into but I liked the spells anyway.Email me if ya wanna chat.	1
I am absolutely addicted to this flavor as well as all of the other bar flavors. This is my breakfast, afternoon pickup or even sometimes my on the go lunch! I am never hungry when I eat my Zoe's Bars!	1
moonstruck has been a favorite love story ,cher never ages.perfect movie for those special nights ,with a bag of pop corn and a beer,and your bab with you.	1
The bag is unusable in the vacuum for which it is marketed. According to the written description and picture, this bag is made for this vacuum. It does not fit the attachment inside the vacuum and is completely unusable. It is a total waste of money.	0
"A glorious acheivment in the history of American Film. Passionately directed and gorgeously photographed, with impeccable acting from Day-Lewis, Binoche and Olin. ""Unbearable"" will linger in your head for weeks after watching it. And it's one of the few movies to use animal death in a non-cheap fashion: The death of Tomas and Tereza's dog is riveting and beautifully performed. Contrary to some opinions, the book is not better than the film; it's an entirely different entity structured in a seemingly unfilmable, non-linear fashion. As a written story, it doesn't make the kind of dramatic sense it does on screen. What Kaufman pulls off with ""Unbearable"" is truly remarkable."	1
My 16 year old daughter told me this film changed her life. I'm getting her into therapy soon. I suppose that as a study in film making techniques and creativity this film breaks some novel ground. Aside from that the characters held no interest for me, a 47 year old. The overdone running scenes comprise about 50% of what is a rather short-running film to begin with. Decent Dolby 5.1 effects. Look for something else!	0
Very exciting with a healthy amount of drama. I'm not sure why this movie didn't do well. It has it's faults but so do many movies that others praise. My biggest complaint about this movie is it has several editing problems. Overall...It is a very entertaining action movie with a fantastic story line.	1
"I bought this film on a whim, since the store I went to didn't have 'exactly' what I wanted (OUATIC 2 fer sure)SO I figured I'd watch the last in the series since OUATIC and America was a HUGE disappointment for me. I have yet to make up my mind on Jet Li films. And this put me in the negative state (again) The story was slow and unmoving, the characters were not interesting, the fighting was sparse (why else get a kung fu film?)and the last fight with Jet in a chicken suit (JET LI IN A CHICKEN SUIT!!!!!)was the last straw. I'm sorry, but if Fist Of Legend was his best, then this must have been by far his worst. ""I wouldn't buy this DVD with YOUR money!!!"""	0

"THE SANSA VIEW IS A GREAT PRODUCT FOR THE PRICE. THE MUSIC SOUND QUALITY IS VERY GOOD BUT LACKS BASS POWER. THE VIDEO PLAYER WORKS GREAT ONCE YOU FIND AN EASIER WAY THAN PROVIDED BY SANDISK. USING THEIR PROVIDED ""SANSA MEDIA CONVERTER"" WHICH CAN BE DOWNLOADED FROM THEIR WEBSITE TAKES HOURS TO CONVERT A MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW, BUT USING THE ""PSP MOVIE CONVERTER"" DOES THE JOB IN COUPLE OF MINUTES AND THEN YOU CAN DRAG AND DROP THE MOVIE TO THE SANSA VIEW USING RHAPSODY MEDIA PLAYER. ONCE I LEARNED TO DO THAT I BEGAN ENJOYING THE PLAYER. THE PICTURE VIEWER IS GREAT AS WELL. I ALSO OFFER THE FM RADIO FOR WHEN U WANNA HEAR SOMETHING DIFFERENT, DSEPERATE FOLDER FOR AUDIOBOOKS AND PODCAST, EXPANSION SLOT. A BANG FOR THE BUCK."	1

This set is fine if you only want to learn Spanish in the Castillian accent. Castillian is a rare accent that you will encounter in certain areas of Spain. No Latin American countries use Castillian! You'd be better off with a different set of software if you truly want to learn the Spanish that most native speakers use.	0
Although Jax presents the gluten free lifestyle with a great attitude, anyone serious about the diet knows that it isn't this easy. The hard info that Jax gives in this book is outright wrong and could be very dangerous to some one new to the diet. She needs to loose the casual approach and get real about being truly gluten free.	0
I like it because it came as I was expecting that , and really helped to save money compare to other stores	1
I've owned 2 beds for over 2 years now and both beds have held up extremely well considering the amount of constant use they've had. One of beds I actually sleep on daily (more comfortable than my regular bed). I had it over 2 years before one of the inner baffels gave way a few weeks ago. I immediatly ordered another bed without hesitation. Very comfortable and super easy to use, with the built in pump, it's a snap to set up and deflate. Love this bed!!	1
I just love this album. I have owned the original album since 1979 and when my eyes fell on the CD in one of our local shops about seven years ago now, I didn't have to think twice and bought it straight away. I still love to listen to it once every so often. The recording quality is just superb, especially on the acoustic recordings! A jazzfunk masterpiece, with a great rythm section (Andy Newmark and Ralph MacDonald), funky bass (Gary King), Bob James on keyboards and the cool and sophisticated flute of the man himself. Huberts interpretations of Ravel's 'Forlane' and Tchaikovsky's 'Romeo and Juliet' are just awsome. Played with tremendous virtuosity, perfect timing and outstanding deliverance! If you are in to jazz and funk but you love your classical music too, you are going to be hooked, I know I am!	1
I bought this CD much time ago but now I have the chance to review it.First thing I can say is that this album is one of the best albums in the world!All the songs are great and I cannot spend a day without listening to it.Shirley's vocal performance is perfect as usual!After listening to Garbage's albums the other albums don't give me the same pleasure.GARBAGE is surely the best band in the universe for me and the members are really great people!I'm sure they will continue their success with their 3rd Album and if I was going to a deserted island, one of the 3 things that I'd take would be VERSION 2.0 (the others would be the batteries and my CD player for listening to it :))	1
This is a great book that may change your running for ever for the better. Very well written and easy to understand. If you read about POSE running which has more scientific explanation about the correct form of running, essentially says the same as this book does. Forget about heel strike and lift off with your toes. Learn how to run with mid-foot strike under your body (not in front) and lean forward (which will work as your gas pedal as you are taking advantage of the gravity) without bending at your waist. It is like controlled fall. You will find you are spending less energy and your risk of injury is less as well.	1
I have been using Pampers BabyDry for a longtime. My son is 17 months now and it works like a charm. It stays dry for a longtime where few other brands gave a bad smell. This one doesnt smell at all and good quality.I wud recommend this to everyone. ***** out of 5 stars. :-)	1
A must have for those wanting to know about the growth of civil aviation in the 1920's and beyond.	1
"Clay's debut cd is a fine first effort. However, it would have been a steller debut had more of the songs sounded a little more different from each other. At first listen it was hard to know when one ended and one started. Also, I was hoping for at least one roof shattering over-the-top showcase for that powerful voice of his. The single ""Invisible"" is a great pop song that deserves to be heard on radio, but I think mainstream radio may not embrace it due to the current hip hop domination and there is not a rap artist to be found. AC radio should add it without hesitation though. With all that said, this cd is definately worth a listen. He has a great future."	1
The Sunsout No Room at The Inn Puzzle has oddly shaped pieces that are somewhat difficult to put together. I am currently still working on it, but so far, it looks great! I would recommend this puzzle to anyone with a little extra time on their hands and the love of solving puzzles. Overall, I am very happy with my purchase.	1
"""Fahrenheit 451"" a metaphor on the freedom of speech. It is not in literary terms that knowledge can be controlled by burning books; there are other ways to accomplish that. As the world is full of people; running with lit matches. Ray Bradbury is basing his attack on every editor; censor; lobbyist; government that see themselves as the caretaker of knowledge and literature; and they control by shackle the words of an author who dare to speak out.The question is very relevant to present times. The news is splattered with stories of doctored intelligence documents; on the bases of which dreaded events occurred."	1
This unit is well built and works really well. It was just used to startup from a drained battery(left my Mac on battery all nite..duh). Well, at 0% charged, I plugged this unit in and starting web browsing, in minutes the charge was at 2% and rising, as well as keeping up with the browsing demands. For the price, it cannot be beat. It also seems I keep forgetting to unplug the original charger when I pack to do travelling, so this new unit makes a great spare to keep packed in my laptop case.	1
"still well worth reading, whether you are looking for something light to take the edge off a long day at work or something a little heavier to pose a few interesting questions. Small Gods is the only Discworld novel I've read, so I can't compare it to the rest of Pratchett's work, but it grabbed my attention and held it. It's a many-layered book, but Pratchett doesn't force the reader to go any deeper than they feel like. Knowing Latin is an asset in reading (he can come out and say more adult things which he leaves implied in English.) Also, this book doesn't have either a ""British"" or an ""American"" feel, which so much fantasy falls into. Overall, excellent."	1
Like other reviewers I also grew up watching A Charlie Brown Christmas when CBS showed it every December and I liked every minute of it including the heartwarming speech by Linus about the true meaning of Christmas and I think this is a great Christmas cartoon but I was disappointed with the extra feature cartoon It's Christmas Time Again Charlie Brown because It was very uneven and choppy!	1
"A very good read, this novel is more ""complex"" in the character development then Tai Pan or Noble House. But the plot centers on an anti-hero, and shows the darker side of capitalism. A sharp break from the heroic figures of industry that I personally loved in Tai Pain and Noble House. After finishing the book you may be a little upset and wondering ""what the point was the novel trying to get across?"" I honestly don't know, the ending leaves you trying to figure things out on your own. But that's the beauty of the book at the same time as its biggest fault. This is a book you appreciate more and more after finishing it."	1
Bought this book along with Fodor's 05 New York City Guide and New York Eyewitness Travel Guide for our trip to New York in August. Overall this was the least informative book. The biggest problem is that the book mainly focuses on where to eat and where to stay, not what to see. If you want a book that details sights better, I would pick Fodor's 05 New York City Guide. I carried the book with me almost every day in New York, while the Frommer's guide was left in the hotel room to press flowers from the botanical garden.	0
This book was a really good book. I especially like how it's a sports novel but also explains life lessons. The story is about two friends that both want to pitch for their baseball team but the team only wants one pitcher, one of the friends is the captain of the team and decides the positions and assigns himself pitcher. The other friend feels left out and they split up. This book has some great morals, 1. Don't single one person out. 2. Let everyone try. 3.realize your friends. By: Dominic, A Sixth Grader from Mainep.s. Matt Christopher ROCKS!!!	1
I made the mistake of watching this with my kids and family after church one Sunday. I had no idea there would be a rape scene! For kids stick with the Halmark version with Matt Frewer.	0

"and I wish that no back-up singers were used, as his voice stands alone, and doesn't need any ""enhancing/help.""I hope on his next album Clay will sing more acapella songs, that have a wide range to show off his voice, without any back-up singers and loud music. I want to hear the real/raw voice of ""Clay.""You're still number one with me!Clay, I wish you all the best, please don't let Hollywood ""corrupt"" you. Stay your humble self.Blessings to you!!"	1
I attended a small buisness class at my local community college, this book was used as our text-book. I found it to be very informative and easy to read. The section concerning Business Plan development was very helpful. I recomend this book to anyone trying to find their way through the myrad of information available when starting a small business. The book is very down to earth, in every chapter there are at least 2 real world examples or case studies for the student to compare to his or own experience	1
Up to now, I have enjoyed almost all of the Higgins books, although they have tended to become more samey. I was particularly disappointed by Edge Of Danger. The tired old characters of Dillon, Ferguson etc are dragged out again for this entirely predictable, highly contrived and unbelievable yarn. The plots have all been used before, and if you've read any two other Dillon books you'll be able to guess the next line throughout. I bought it to read on the plane - was bored by check in and had finished it long before boarding. Give this one a miss.	0

I haven't downloaded many movies yet, but when I have, the wireless adapter has worked fine. I would forget it's there, except now I'm able to order movies! Too bad more stuff doesn't work like that. I haven't had to use their customer service, but that's the best kind of customer service.	1
I bought this book because I wanted to try VSCROG. I found the book to have great info on VSCROG and SOG. I also found the book offered other great info in a format that was easily understood. It is a great book for any cannabis growers library.	1
I tried for over a month to fine tune the settings to keep the connection from dropping. But intermittently the connection would always fail. Sometimes after an hour and other times after 24 hours. If I stopped the device through the device manager and then restarted it, it would usually reconnect for awhile. I finally gave up and bought a Linksys WMP54G. Which works great. Maybe I just got a lemon.	0
What a great album!!! I never knew she sang as well. I have seen her in French movies and enjoyed greatly her acting in those movies. Now I even adore her more, because not only can she act, but she can sing as well!!!Go Charlotte Go!!!! Can't wait for her next album.	1
"It really works! This is my second one. I have the smaller one at my boyfriend's place. My laptop gets hot since it is a 12"" with a touchscreen. And I can really tell the difference. I give it 4 stars because it isn't the most comfortable for a lap but it isn't uncomfortable. I would really give it 4.5. And the mouse piece is great. Don't need it with the plus and small laptops but definitely need it for the smaller lapinator. JustMake sure you put the border on or the mouse slides off. The border foam is included. I bought two so I do love this product. It may have a silly name but it definitely works!"	1
It was just what I thought it was. I loved it. I watched a couple of time. I'll have to take it with me to my brothers so my nephews can see it.	1

undoubtedly the worst piece of equipment i have ever owned. literally threw it into the street less then twenty minutes ago. the only enjoyable experience was heaving it fifteen feet into the air and watching it splatter in the driveway.paper jams, ink problems and general misery all around.would give this a negative 5 stars if i could.	0
Ok, before I bought this DVD, I read all the reviews and I was prepared for it to be really annoying. IT WAS! She gets on your nerves. She LOVES to act, and she thinks she is really funny, but it gets old quick. On the other hand, I was so glad that I sat thru it because me and my husband learned so much. It was too late for us to get into a class, and this was really so informative, and it went over pretty much everything you need to know about going thru labor or having a c-section. So, for the people who said it wasnt enough cuz you didnt get to interact with couples or instructor, why did you buy it? Its great if you cant go to a class. What you learn is the most important part of this, isnt it?	1
Hazlitt's view is simple: economics can only be understood if we look at the effects on everyone over time. He views most government economic tinkering as myopic: focussing only on one group of people for a moment. He shows how government intervention--well intentioned as it might be--always hurt people in general over the long-term including the people we mean to help. He champions the forgotten man--the people who are hurt when the governmet tries to improve on the workings of the marketplace.	1
"I love Andy Borowitz' humor in ""The Borowitz Report"", and always read it. This slim book just doesn't have much substance, however. It should have just been used for a couple of ""Reports""."	0
Of the 5 books I own that explain Seismic Refraction principles, Professor Burger is the only one who took the time to walk you thru step-by-step on interpreting a Seismogram. That is the sign of a true teacher and an Author who's not afraid of a little extra effort to help his students practically apply the knowlege. I only wish I lived closer to attend his classes!I do agree with the others in that an IBM PC version of the diskettes is long overdue, but this book still gets my 5 star rating!	1
I bought this to get better fuel mileage, but didn't get it.It will give you more power, but forget it if you're looking for better economy.Even using hypermile techniques (light foot, coasting as much as possible) there was no change in economy.	0
"I have the Live From New Haven DVD and wasn't very impressed with the audio and picture quality. This VHS has a better picture quality and it sounded better. Not only that but it had back stage footage AND Pat Benatar performing ""Little Paradise"" as the last encore which wasn't shown on the Live From New Haven DVD/ or that 1998 VHS release. Also included was the video Love Is A Battlefield as it was a quick promo for the upcoming LP Live From Earth. I cannot find anywhere where she sings Little Paradise Live so I feel like the lucky few now!"	1
The designers threw in the works and the lone star represents a point for design ingenuity. Problem is this toy is nearly impossible to build and it's more than the comically unreadable directions that are at fault. I have built many a toy but never found one this resistant to having its snap on parts snap on and of course if and when they finally do, the least shake will undo your labor. Sure to end in tears and frustration for all.	0
Terry Pratchett continues the Discworld tradition in fine fashion with Small Gods. Brutha, a lowly, simple-minded novitiate of a mighty religious empire, has just met his god face-to-face. Actually, heel-to-face, because the mighty god Om is really a not-so-mighty tortoise who is out to reclaim his empire -- with Brutha's help	1
"This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. It was fast pace and very entertaining. I really enjoy the ""ending."" The lead character Lola is awesome she is tough and also very feminine at the same time. I would highly recommend this film."	1

Chopper Girl's debut album on HooDoo Labs is a throwback to an older often times forgotten subgenre of Memphis rap.The album has dark overtones and rides a fine line between Horrorcore and Gangsta Rap. Touching on a variety of subjects Chopper Girl seems to show she isn't a one trick pony and this album has selections ranging from a high octane posse cut to dark and sinister tracks that are heavily influenced by vodou and all the way back to selections that will easily get people moving in the clubs and c-walking on the streets. A veritable whose who of Memphis artists make guest appearances both vocally and on the production side of the house. I highly recommend this for anyone who is a fan of Memphis underground.	1
Shallow and empty horror movie that manages to lower your I.Q. while you are watching it with a flat out horrible performance by Keanu Reeves, who manages to make his matrix performances look Oscar worthy by comparison. The direction by first time director Frances Lawrence lacks passion for the material and not to mention professionalism and the script is by far the most offensive thing in the entire film with a very confusing story line that does not make much sense and some pretty incredible bad dialog. My heart goes out to some of the good actors in this film, who does bring their amazing talent to this waste of celluloid especially Rachel Weisz, who manages to overcome the very bad script to give a tight and powerful performance that the movie clearly does not deserved. The one star in this review goes to her for her valiant effort to give a good performance despite the horrible script and her retarded leading man.	0

If you have a tivo and haven't gotten Wi-fi, I highly recommend doing so with this adapter. Particularly, if like me you had one that didn't sit near a telephone line. It was easy to set up and works well even though my second Tivo is three rooms away from my computer/wireless router. Besides avoiding the problem of having to string a phone line once a week to make sure your tivo doesn't run out of programming info, it also ensures you're able to fully use of all of the available features - including scheduling recordings from any computer when you're away from home.	1

it's an interesting idea to have a operatic female vox in a metal band; however, her voice is mediocre (you'd know it's true if you know some names from the opera genre), and the music is not original at all. Does anyone know any similar bands (with operatic female vox) that are better than this? Let me know. Thanks!	0

This book is simply indespensible, if one is serious about his trading. I have been trading for about 4yrs now. And only purchased the book because its a pre-requiste for CFT exams.I am amazed at how its has changed my prespectives towards trade managment.Again an absolute must if you want to commit funds trading in a relaxed & profitable manner.I am quite sure that the LORD, could have bestowed his Grace on Magee, and placed him in paradise because of it.GOD REST HIS SOUL.	1
I bought this to be a candle warmer, not a mug warmer, but they are all the same. I like this one because it is black, so it isn't as noticeable on the dresser where it sits. The white one I had previously worked great, but it was so ugly on the dark wood. I am very pleased with the way it works.	1
Quite possibly one of the best books ever written. The first time I read this book I was incredibly sick and promised myself (at about 7 pm) that I would read just 1 or 2 chapters and get to bed. At 1:00 that morning, I found myself turning the last page, awestruck, wishing I had the energy to read it just one more time before I slept. This book is surreal, empowering and cathartic all at the same time. It brings mythical characters who often feel cold and drab in mere textbook descriptions to life as utterly human, modern characters with a depth of feeling and thought beyond the scope of that captured in most novels.	1
Haven't had an opportunity to use them yet, but after examining them they appear to be a quality product , I'm sure they will be just fine and work as expected.	1
"The best ""dance"" CD I've heard since Leftism. Excelllent lyrics, kicking ragga and bhangra bass; good, trippy guitar work, fat riddims and skankin' dub. This record completely captures the political mood of the new century. I am extremely impressed and shall be buying other ADF soon!"	1
"Don't support this huckster by buying his book. Read some of the reviews of his anti-aging book or talk to a nutritionist or a scientist at the UCLA School of Public Health. The REAL nutritionists (with REAL credentials) will tell you he is a quack.""Milk is pus from a cow"" according to Null. This is the lowest form of proselytizing -- trying to sell an idea by appealing to a ""disgust factor."" Milk is a good and essential food for those who are not allergic or intolerant. His nutrition advice is damaging; teenagers, the elderly, and those with chronic illness could develop protein, iron, and calcium deficiencies following his program.Also note this: he is secretive about the field in which he has a PhD. Could it be in business?"	0
"Sweat and Suit were two of the absolute worst albums of last year. Sadly, both of those disasters are being re-packaged and released again. Everything on here is just terrible. ""Grillz"" is also one of the worst songs I've ever heard all year. It figures that only Nelly would make a stupid song about his diamond teeth. It also figures he'd make a song with that horrible H-Town rapper Paul Wall. I blame Nelly for the state of hip hop today. He also created hip-pop which is one of the worst music genres ever created. Hell Cash Money and G-Unit make better club songs than this idiot. One of the year's absolute worst albums."	0
"I got this book hoping to get more insight on, well, ""cases that haunt us"". This book and several others by Douglas, turned out to be a self-serving puff piece on several complicated cases. This is the literary equivelant of Leslie Neilsen in ""The Naked Gun"" saying ""Move along, there's nothing to see here"" as a fireworks warehouse explodes behind him.Some of these cases deserve serious examination and not a simplistic write-off. Check out Terry Maury's ""The Ultimate Evil"" to see where thorough investigation of these crimes can lead."	0
"This was my first experience reading Hazlitt and it won't be my last. He has an ""Adam Smith"" way of writing (whether intentional or not, who's to tell) and everytime I wanted to compare this book to Wealth of Nations, I quickly curbed my enthusiasm. This is a good book, not great and I'm not quite sure why all the great reviews. I do like his way of explaining some very difficult economic ideas and I can see this book being a valuable introduction to economic principles, maybe not economics 101. In summary, well worth your time to read but not a good enough book to truly fit it's title."	1
Tess of the D'Urbervilles is one of the worst books I have ever read. I read this book in high school, though I am now in college, but don't discount this review because of that. Tess has absolutely no backbone. She pines away for stupid Angel who is more cruel to her than the guy who raped her in many ways. I know women weren't as strong at that time but even so, she is still pathetic. When she tells Angel that she would jump in the river and kill herself for him, I laughed out loud! Tess is a spineless, pathetic excuse for a human being. She needs to take some lessons from Jane Eyre, a hundred times better heroine. Also, Hardy describes the same stupid valley so many times that the book drags on forever and seems like it is never going to end. I disliked all of the characters so much, that it made the book have not one redeeming quality to it. If you want to read a Hardy book, read Mayor of Casterbridge--it is much better!	0
"I have never given a movie 1 star before but here it is. ""Woman in the Fifth"" offers very little in the way of plot or relevancy for that matter. The characters are flat, dull, and the dialog is less than inspiring. This movie is about nothing, literally. There is no back story of any characters, no motivation for their actions or lack there of, nothing. Just nothingness. And then it ends thankfully."	0
It was a great way of handling a detective story. From his hospital bed the detective solved an old mystery to counteract boredom. It was done with documents of the time and told me that even centuries ago history was manipulated. I liked it.	1
It costs a lot because its an IMPORT, not a bootleg! If you're going to enjoy the CD, might as well enjoy it knowing that you didn't pay too much money for a crook to burn the CD for you. Honestly. Things cost money. To a real fan, this is worth the money. Costs a crook a penny to create a mediocre bootleg. Do you really think you're saving money?	1
I sent this unit back to Amazon! Its form factor is contrary to what it says.The camera is small, as they state, but attached to it is a bulky power cable and 9v battery connector. When you hook it all up it's huge! No longer a stealthy camera. Ridiculous!It does not serve its intended purpose.MUVI turned out to be my replacement choice. All reviews are excellent. The image is excellent and it records for hours on an internal battery. There are lots of examples on YouTube.TaosGuy	0
Reaching for the Light takes a very simple approach to a complex subject. Emilie Rose certainly researched ritual abuse well for having known about her own abuse for only one year prior to writing this book. In my opinion it takes years of therapy and intensive work to fully understand the damage done and the path to healing for the deep problems within. Any therapist who has worked with a ritual abuse victim for more than a year would not get anything from this book. Neither would anyone who has been in this hellhole beyond the initial discovery stage. My advice is to skip this book.	0
"I ordered 4 copies from Amazon and hate to give any away as I planned so will buy more to have one in every car and room. It is absolutely amazing and please don't listen to the remnants of Ruben's fans who are rating Clay badly because they are still disappointed that ""their"" hero will go nowhere.Every song is outstanding, just as Clay is and it is overwhelming that he can do so fantastic on so many songs in such a short time.

"Well whats to like about it other than the title track?The radio edit cuts out a big chunk of the outro and some of the intro and the 7"" version keeps a bit of the intro and still cuts out the outro. Wolf in sheeps clothing is 5 minutes of looping drums and bassline with cheesy 80's synth over the top.Overall though if you want all the songs, be sure to get the 5 track jewel case version as the cardboard slipcase with trays get annoying and damaged easy and its easier to have 1 cd with all the songs on it rather than 2."	0
Shriekback's Barry Andrews is a genius of the highest order. This album has the band ditch all synthesizers (A bold move! Electronics being heretofore their main life-blood.) Andrews' garage sale of the sorts of machines worshiped by pale Englishmen with funny haircuts and their ilk frees him up to add yet another depth to the Shriekback sound. Attempts to express my enthusiasm for works of art like the contents on this CD are ineffable - at least on my part - but I do want to register my 5 stars, and hope that anybody who follows my other recommendations will try this great work of art as well. This is like eavesdropping on Shriekback in a world of no electricity. Thank God somebody was cranking a generator or some such device in order to record this work. AWESOME in the organic, original sense of the word. BUY! BUY! BUY!	1
There is NO VIDEO in this thing, just music. If there is a video on the disc, there are NO INSTRUCTIONS what so ever on how to play it. The only print on this are a bunch of stupid rants about piracy is good. But there is NO VIDEO here.	0
Our daughter is 22 months and we just got a box of Size 5 baby Dry diapers. We can't use these at nighttime and we have to check her diaper frequently. If she drinks a lot of water, the urine leaks right out of the diaper.My wife had me order another box of Huggies Snug & Dry Size 5 immediately. We'll try to use these ones up, but when we run errands or go to church, we will use the Huggies.I do not recommend these diapers at all. It's not worth the $0.03 difference per diaper from Huggies. I gave it a fair chance and learned my lesson.	0

After a long hiatus from the Man-Kzin wars, I purchased the Man-Kzin Wars IX. The stories in M-K Wars IX were average at best. Of the 4 stories, the murder mystery was my favorite. The story about the crippled Kzin's last stand started well but deteriorated into a long-winded mutual admiration fest between the antagonists during the battle for Wunderland's liberation. It made as much sense as the Russians negotiating with and praising the positive qualities of the bunkered Germans during the battle for Berlin. The last story needed a good editor to clean it up, especially the beginning, and make it more coherent. IMO, this book is not worth buying and inferior to its predecessors.	0
"Brilliant music made by old friends from the era when swing was still forming but at the same time the foundations of modern jazz were layed in Fletcher Henderson's orchestra (""Queer Notions"" and some other songs).This is a really hot and swinging Henry ""Red"" Alllen's slightly dixielandish date, featuring Coleman Hawkins (tenor sax) J. C. Higginbotham (trombone), Buster Bailey (clarinet), Cozy Cole (dm), as well as some younger but still hot players.However, the leader is particularly expressive in the ballad ""I Cover the Waterfront"" - no wonder I found it cited as one of the classical Allen's performances. Late fifties were good not only for modern explorations: this hot hi fi session gives great joy to us fans of classical jazz who sometimes whish that the recording technology in the 20's and 30's was a bit more advanced..."	1
"I read this book for a class, and I am sorry to say that it was a disappointment. It is a silly tale, and totally unrealistic. I cannot believe that something like this could be considered a ""classic"". Mike sure made some dumb choices, and it is unrealistic! No one could make that many blunders. It was bogged down by unnecessary details, etc. All-in-all, a 100% waste. Don't buy this book. You've been warned."	0
"I praise Ostebee and Zorn for making an attempt to make calculus easy and for everyone. But I just don't think that is true. Calculus is a sophisticated form of mathematics and sometimes it needs to be taught with vocabulary and methods within the mathematics community and outside of everyday life. When you combine this with the usual high number of mistakes present in a first-edition book, a great deal of the phrase ""we'll discuss/define this soon"", excessive use of the graphing calculator, and some pretty lame jokes, you get a product that's not really worthy of being used in a college-level course."	0
Nice Euro mix for a united states tour. For progressive fans this is a must have for the collection.Wish I was there........not sure if the once a year concert is still happening.	1
I have had mine for a month now and have to say I have enjoyed it. The Pros:Price! Almost half what an ipod would cost you! I don't care how it looks and I always drive so the size is not important to me.Sound quality is wonderful, I really like the smart volume sound normalization. Yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway. I quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song/playlist etc fast enough. I also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer!Cons. Creative software stinks. It's horrible. redchair software makes nice software that allows you to do everything you would want to and more! The front cover can pop off easily but I always have mine in the case so I didn't notice after first day.	1
Works on many levels, but it can be read as a great adventure like Ivanhoe or Treasure Island. Religon mixed with science and technology; where is the line between them? What direction can the corruption of absolute power take, when that power is life after death! What could be done, if one could live a thousand lifetimes? What would you do to live just one more lifetime? The most disappointing thing to me, is that the author, in my opinion has never come close to equaling this book, but then, no one else has either.	1
"I started the book with having read the Old Man and the Boy first, so I was primed and ready for some good reading. I was not disappointed, Robert C. Ruark is a Masterful Wordsmith. I savored each word as a ""Right before You Go to Sleep"" read, the book was the High Point of the Day on a number of days, it always provided an exit into sleep after what lately have become stressful days. This should be required reading for anyone who hunts, it provides a distinct familiarity for anyone who has hunted. I felt that, I know that, I was Touched."	1
Give me a break. I do not see what all the fuss is about. I listened to this CD and although Clay sings well, the songs are boring ballads and they all sound the same. I agree with all the negative reviews from the media. This album is nothing to get excited about and I sure wouldn't waste my money on it. You'll get more for you money with Josh Groban's new CD.	0
Worst Nicholas Cage movie ever made. See the Harvey Keitel version for a great watch.	0
This album is just plainly a dissapointment. Half the album is brilliant and the other half, well they should have just put this out as and e.p. with only half of the songs. Sure Pillars, Every shining time, and How it feels to be, are brilliant. But they are ruined by 100 million, Two Promises, and Roses in Water. I expected this to be their best album (after hearing Jeremy's solo album, which is a must buy) but it just turns out to studio, which means not that much emotion. Sure Jeremy is screaming, but there is nothing in his scream. Maybe Nate was more important than they'll admit. The emo is only slightly there and that is what they are EMO! Not alt-rock. Don't start with this one. Buy Diary, and hear what one of the most promising bands of all time used to sound like. Maybe they shouldn't have gotten back together.	0
The developers at Eidos really blew it this time. The game is so full of bugs it makes me sick. First of all, the box says nothing about laptop compatability problems, but upon checking the Eidos tech support page, you learn that they won't support laptop systems.Anyways, I installed the software on my desktop. The game crashes every several minutes. I have installed all of the newest drivers and my computer excedes the recommended hardware profile in every way. Gameplay is tolerable, but nowhere near as good as I had hoped it would be. In fact, Chronicles was more fun and was more of a challenge.I ended up returning the game because it is not only not worth the money, but it is also a waste of time. If you do take the gamble, make sure you buy this game from a store that accepts software returns. Good luck!	0
Great for kids who like legos and never have enough doors and windows. Will keep them busy for hours.	1
This book, contaning Chandlers later works, is perhaps the best collection of Chandler you can find. Sure, does not contain the better-known novels - The Big Sleep and Farewell my Lovely - but it does contain The Long Goodbye, which is not only Chandler's finest, but a great novel by any measure.Chandler lived a tough, hard-drinking life, and these later works came out of his mind with difficulty. But the quality of The Lady in the Lake and The Long Goodbye (The Little Sister is less memorable) make this collection essential.In addition, the book contains some essays and letters, including Chandler's writing on the mystery genre, which will interest any budding suspense author.In short, read this book! Read The Long Goodbye, then read it again. This is not just a great mystery, but it is also great literature.	1
Clay Aiken's outstanding voice and song delivery are showcased perfectly on this cd. His vocal power and range are phenomenal and the songs themselves are terrific as well. At long last, a person rises to the top of the charts who is in actual possession of real talent! At long last, a major label has produced a cd with the recognition that the content of the music can be mature without being trash or treating vices as though they're, indeed, acceptable. It's been a long time since I've listened to pop for the simple reason that I was tired of wading through the filth and innuendo to hear a few bars I liked. Clay Aiken appeals to true emotion and feeling. This only came out today and already, I'm anxiously waiting for the next CD.	1
These Pampers have been the winners for our son - no leaks, super absorbent, easy to put on.The equivalent Huggies were a disaster - no matter how tight we put the Huggies on him, he managed to wriggle around and get some pee out of one gap or another. So he needed a new onesie for every diaper change....In cloth diapers, we have to change him as soon as he pees or poops, because the cloth diapers are not as absorbent. He's not used to the wet feeling, and he does NOT like it! So we use one cloth diaper a day, just to give him a break / change of pace.If not for these Pampers, our lives would be a lot less pleasant right now.	1
"I just finished reading this wonderful book about the Northern European myths that Tolkien borrowed and reshaped to make the lands, people, and languages of Middle-earth come alive. For the price and content, this is a great value. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in Tolkien's fiction!"""	1
I got these diapers for my retarted uncle. He suffered a kick to the head from a horse at 15 when he was trying to shave his back end. Ever Sence my uncle has been unable to do basic bodly functions. So we put these on him after we hose him down. He just loves the feel on his chaped hairless hair. Saddly to say tho after a night with a hungry man meal my poor uncle blew the ass end out of these diapers! The smell was terrable and my Dad had to get the hose and not only beat my uncle he also had to hose down our poor cat. I called up the manufactor trying to get them to pay for the damages. They refused!!!!	0
This was a Christmas memory that I had as a child. We always used to watch it. Still lovely today.	1
I've seen better episodes on TV. Forgettable, don't even remember what it was about and it wasn't long ago that I saw it.	0
Nothing much to say here. It's well filmed, but it's the story I don't like. I like happy endings. Don't expect a happy ending on this one. Very disturbing.	0
I saw this movie in theaters the day after it came out and I loved this movie. I understand why some fans don't like it because of the changes, but I think those changes should be looked passed and respect it for what it is. Its a whole other Mario universe with directors way over their head. But the end product is amazing. I suggest everyone watch it, and those who have seen it and didn't like it, watch it again because you know what you're going into.	1
This book is very important for american descendants living in Brazil. We can't let the culture dies.	1
I hate this thing. It worked for about a month and that is it. It has driver problems. After 5 hours on the phone with Rhapsody, 2 hrs. with Sansa it still does not work. I have downloaded everything for this. It does not work. Waste of money, time. Very disappointed.	0
This is somewhere up there as one of the worst movies I ever saw. Its not hard to find faults in this movie because its full of them.I was horrified by how poorly the first rollerball game scene was shot. It was so uninteresting and almost impossible to follow what was going on that it was PATHETIC. There was no doubt in my mind after the first fifteen minutes that this was the worst intro to a film I had ever seen.It got somewhat better as the weak plot developed and there was less action shots of them playing this ridiculous game.I normally end with something positive, but there was none. NONE at all.I must admit to watching the whole thing... a sucker for punishment. I would never watch it again, and could never recommend this film to anyone.A real letdown	0
I bought this movie to show our faith- based preschool group when we were studying Native Americans. Although it may not be historically accurate, if you talk about various Native American groups being different vs. stereotyping, I think this is appropriate to show for that age group.	1
I purchased the next size up for my son for nighttime. I have never had a leak this badly before where it went up his chest and sides. I'm going to try the Huggies nighttime diapers.	0
This book is about three generations of strong southern women. My favorite character by far was the grandmother and matriarch, Charlie Kate. She is a self taught healer, and treats her patients with a combination of common sense and tradition. Charlie Kate is feisty and isn't afraid to speak her mind or take on the powers that be. I also dearly loved the relationship she has with her granddaughter (and of course it made me think of my own grandmothers often).	1
I agree with the other two star reviewer for this book. Nothing seems real or convincing in this work. If this had been the first MacDonald book I read I would not have read another.The plot read like the cheap 60's motorcycle themed movies the book kept discussing. I didn't believe any of it. Travis reluctant to grieve over a woman he knew that was brutally murdered because he couldn't focus in on her personality just amazed me.Even if you're addicted to the series as I am; don't read this one!	0
There are plenty of other great books on parenting twins & other multiples out there -- do yourself a favor & don't buy this one! First of all, it is very technical & difficult/unpleasant to read. Second, it has pictures of women after childbirth with like several feet of hanging extra skin -- not something I needed to see when I was emotional and pregnant with two. It also had the most negative, scary tone. It seemed to tell you all of the things that could go WRONG and very little of what could go right. Let me tell you, from a woman who has been there -- it can go beautifully & without incident -- & not everyone ends up with miles of extra skin on their stomachs. If you buy this book while pregnant, it will only serve to scare the wits out of you. Save yourself the stress and look elsewhere for good information!	0
"i purchased this thinking it was the ORIGINAL crocodile dentist. this one is FAR FROM IT. first of all, it is about the size of my hand. yes, very very very small. it does not take batteries. you simply ""push"" the teeth down with your finger one at a time and when you press a certain tooth, it trigger the jaw to close on your finger. but, the jaw is held open with just a spring attachement which often malfunctions. and when the jaw closed on my sons little finger (only 3), the top part of the crocodile just fell off. it is CHEAPLY MADE! the picture is also misleading - this one has braces. i do not remember the original crocodile dentist having braces on its top teeth. completely bored my son."	0
"At the mention of 1984, critics will prostrate worshipping Orwell's mastery of metaphors, readers will rejoice at his clarity, and soothsayer's will marvel at his prescience. 1984 has even spawned new english words like ""doublethink"" and ""newspeak"". And along with capri pants, it seems in fashion to like 1984. This praise is not meritless and Orwell did indite a great book; however, it didn't grab me the way other books have. For me a good beginning makes me stick with a book, and this is something 1984 lacks. The beginning is ponderous and confusing, and I debated giving up on the book numerous times, but I remembered all the adulatory reviews and decided to stick with it. I am glad I did because the story picks up and still maintains its themes. The beginning did tarnish my view of 1984 a little though and I was still cynical of the praise it receive; after my cynicism disperesed I realized the book did deserve the praise--if the reader can bear the beginning."	1
We bought this baby dry I think this is great mistake done by me. Its getting wet so soon. Before we were using cruisers but we thought why don't we try this once. Never ever buy this pampers baby dry.	0
"I bought one at Target and I wish I had bought two. Now they are out of stock and I can't find one. For the price, this product delivers fine sound. I agree with some previous reviewers on the issue of the battery, but that is a minor point. I love the sound!!! It also has good radio reception for stations that are at the fringe of the FM reception band. I did not buy it as a clock radio, but as a less expensive alternative to Bose. At $400 less than the comparable Bose, I say ""go for it'! I hope it is available soon."	1
I ordered these sheets hoping for that comfy flannel sheet I remembered from the old days. Snuggling under the covers in the Fall and Winter, cosseted by soft sheets. Perhaps, I was too optimistic, given the price.These sheets seem to be fairly good quality, but they don't have that fuzzy softness of flannel. There's really not much nap. They are made of a low thread count sort of jersey fabric. The patterns are good, and they come packaged nicely, but in an era where high thread count sheets are available affordably, these sheets are a disappointment.If you like jersey-type sheets, and you aren't too concerned about the softness right out of the package or the thread count, these could be just right for you. And you can't beat the price.	0
I just bought this product...it totally removed my wart on my index finger...i am amazed how fast it took, when i tried other products which took forever and still the wart came back.thank you for making this product...	1
"The dimensions of the miter slot are not provided for this item. Probably because it is undersize. The dimension is 1/4"" deep x 3/4"" wide. This means that any standard miter gauge or sliding shaper jig, will ride high and rock side to side with no table support. The miter gauge supplied is all plastic and is a grand total of 3"" long.It is also difficult to adjust the extension table sections low enough so that they do not interfere with the sliding miter gauge or shaper jig.The only plus on this set-up is a large, easy to access on/off switch.I don't understand why anyone would manufacture an item with so many shortcomings, when it would be just as easy to make the thing right in the first place.The best use for this product would be to mount a non-functioning router, and give the set to a child to play 'Carpenter' with.PS: Shipping was very expensive, ie: 50% of the cost of the item."	0
I have been using my zen xtra for 3 months now and i am very pleased with it. I can drag and drop songs with the nomad explorer. I can listen to it for 15hrs at a time before it needs a recharge and it holds my whole collection of cds.There are however a few cons to this product.The plastic clip that comes on the carring case snaped so I replaced it with a nylon strap I sewed onto the back of the case and havn't had a problem since.There are two things that could really improve this product, a line out and a fm transmiter to use to play in cars that have only a cd player.This is an awsome mp3 player and well worth the money.	1
I have got it with a crack in the disk when I got it and also I do not now how it play I cannot play it with the crack in the disk and yes I let them now about it nothing was done about it	0
"I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."	1
My husband and I didn't have time to attend an 8 hour birthing class at the hospital, so we opted for this video. It was very informative and helped us understand what was happening when we went to the hospital. It was a little cheesy, but definitely worth getting.	1
THIS TOY ISNT APPROPRIATE FOR YOUR GROWING CHILDREN AS THEY TEND TO SEND THE WRONG MESSAGETO CHILDREN(OR AT LEAST MOST)THAT CHILDREN SHOULD DRESS LIKE US BRATZ. NO! PARENTS SHOULDN'T ALLOW THEIR KIDS TO DRESS LIKE SLUTS SO DON'T BUY THIS DOLL! THE MOST RIDICULOUS THING IS THAT THESE DOLLS ARE IN THEIR BABY STAGE OR ATLEAST SO BUT THEY DARE DRESS SO SKANKILY!	0

I am a Speech Therapist and this is a toy that the children with whom I work (3,4, and 5 year olds) ask for over and over again. They just love it! I have the small travel one which is perfect since I travel all around for my job. If the child is too afraid to push the teeth down I give him/her a tongue depressor or my pencil so the crocodile bites that instead of the child.	1
"""Final Analysis"" is one of the worst, silliest films I have ever seen. I have now abandoned Philip Joanou's filmography. It is slavishly formulaic, and just plain dumb, they couldn't even get the effects right. This is one of the few times that you will most certainly find something better on the Lifetime Network instead."	0
As with other Books by the Bronwen and Franse Stiene this is an excellent read on energy and Reiki. They really know their stuff!	1
Good product. Purchased the same once before so I knew what I was getting. If I can get something that works for me and pay half the cost of a famous name brand, I'll certainly do it. Was shipped quickly as usual. What more can be said about this product, ahhh, not too much. Thanks amazon.com .	1
"If you liked Clay Aiken's style of singing on American Idol, you'll love his first album, ""Measure of a Man."" It's packed with songs that fit his character and reveal the force of his voice. You quickly find your favorites, but also the other tracks mysteriously have the power to grow on you as you listen to them the first or second time. You'll go from ""liking it"" to ""what would I do without it"" as you listen to it over time. Fans of vocalists alike with this American Idol show-stealer will embrace this CD more and more as the years go pass - it's a definite great buy!"	1
I notified Digi Acc to let them know that I ordered the wrong battery. I have 2 Canon digitals and they use different batteries. I ordered the Canon NB-5L for the Canon SD950 IS and should have ordered the Canon NB-4L for the Canon ELPH100HS.I called Digi Acc and left them a message and never received a response. If someone would respond, I would like to exchange the battery.	1
"Batman Begins a new generation of Batman movies and if this movie is anything to go on the movies to come will be worth watching and buying. In this movie the as the title states shows the beginning of Batman from where Bruce Wayne was before to how he decided to use the bat and because ""Bats frighten me. It's time my enemies share my dread"" This movie shows the training that Bruce goes through to become batman. I think that Christain Bale (Equilibrium, Reign of Fire, American Psycho) is the best Batman to date, I believe that he will be in the next movie which is at this point untitled. But I eagerly await the release of the sequel"	1
"This book is very detailed, technical and complex. If you're seriously considering exploring the photogravure technique on copper, this book is a must. It tells you everything you will ever need and all the complicated steps in the process. However, there are few historical or contemporary photogravure reproductions which is why this book gets only a four star rating from this reviewer. If you are seriously considering the photogravure process as one you would like to explore, I recommend starting with solar plates rather than copper. It is much less complicated and toxic. A very good resource is ""Printmaking in the Sun"" (2001) by Dan Welden, inventor of this method."	1
My number one all time favorite book. Clarified many things about racism and religion in America, by the most eloquent voice I've ever had the pleasure of reading.	1

Have tried the more expensive product from North American and it cleared up mine and my husband's stuffy noses within 24 hrs. Occasionally you would get a slight after burp with that product. With this product, I've been taking for a week and I still have a stuffy nose and never an after burp. Plus the capsules are huge compared to p73.	0
Hawthorne's dull prose really gets to you after a while. The book is filled with antiquated language, and is basically an account of a Puritan woman who suffers because of her adultery. I was forced to read this book for my English class, and it was a terrible waste of time. Hawthorne hits you in the face with run on sentences that take up the entire page. I do have one good thing to say about this book however, for all you insomniacs out there, read it! It induces sleep in minutes! ZzZzZzZzZzZz.....	0
This is an amazing book. I decided to read it when I found out that Mr. Bradbury had passed away.Even though it's supposed to be fiction, it seems way too familiar, since unfortunately there are so many people who prefer wasting their lives doing unimportant things rather than spending their time reading.I highly reccomend it.	1
The book is essentially a daytime soap opera. Except, none of the characters are likeable.My suggestion: read only the very last line of the book. The book's very existence strives to make this sentiment true.	0
"I was cajoled into reading this ""required reading for all of humanity"" masterpiece. I had to fight to finish this novel - I thought that at the very least, it would be as magical as Allende's House of Spirits, but I was severely disappointed. Unlike everyone else (or so it seems everyone else), this book did not change my sensibilities. The best part of the book was the last 40 or so pages, which ALMOST, almost, made the other 400 pages worthwhile. I do not doubt Garcia Marquez' talent -- what I do believe is a lot was lost in the translation!"	0

After a few uses, I got CF Card Error during a function at home with my Canon G3. Going to try if I can get a replacement.

Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book.	0
Loved this from the moment I put it on the bike. Took a little work, just a little, but switched it to my wife's bike and then back to mine. Some where in there we loaded it down too much and one of the slide in plastic brace ears broke and now it is unusable. Searching for a new way to haul groceries now...	0
Only two little issues with this toy.1. You are gonna want more balls. seriously... order them when you order this product. The balls that come with it are simply not enough. We got a hundred more for a really good price and it made all the difference.2. The basket ball hoop came right off in my sons hands. It wasn't sewn on very well to begin with I guess.Other than that, the seams are holding up well and my two year old loves his tent! I absolutely recomend this toy! Great for rainy day fun or for when it is way too hot outside!	1
I used this amp to power a pair of Anthony Gallo Micro Ti speakers, used the powered Gallo Sub. This amp is perfect for the hidden installation, and the primary connection is to an iPod doc with sVideo to the HDTV to view the choices on the iPod, and to make playlists with out connecting back up to the PC. The second input to the amp, the one that takes over when powered up and providing a signal is connected to a universal disc player, for stereo playback of cd's, and DVD audio. The AMP is quite small, and fits in the corner shaped cabinet that had a very limited depth issue for the electronics components.	1

DON'T BUY IT. DEMAND BETTER QUALITY!"	0
I know! I'm as surprised as you are that I didn't enjoy this much-touted classic! I added it to my list of summer must-reads, and it was probably the worst of the bunch. After the second or third time an expected dramatic climax was suddenly resolved by a literal deus ex machina, the thrill was gone. Maybe Asimov was being ironic?? I did enjoy meeting a trader who could've been a Han Solo relative, but that was the highlight. Asimov fans may enjoy this one, but I will stick to Clarke, Bradbury, and Heinlein.	0
I have bought baby dry diapers before and have been satisfied with it. But this time I ordered it from Amazon. The diapers tear when they are opened from prefolded packing. Sometimes I have even found that the gel or the stuff its made from has leaked. I am extremely dissapointed with this lot of diapers. Now on I'd rather buy it from a store than order oline so its easier to return.	0
Bought this on a Lightning Deal, and have enjoyed it so far. There is a lot of content for the money and it is funny to see what Canadien Broadcasting was like several decades ago. Oh, and there is some good piano playing as well. Gould seems like he was an interesting, if not a little strange, person. It's sad that he died so young of a stroke.	1
This is my favorite DM cd. It is exceedingly moody....which makes it hit you right in the gut. This isn't a dance cd; it's a moody cd. It was meant for your darker emotions; for you to explore them.	1

Absolutely loved this movie. Great message ... unbelievably good things can happen ... even later in life. Breathtaking views of Italy ... This movie never loses its magic.	1
Single in Saudi is a complete work of FICTION! It says so in the copyright. I have made that mistake before so now I always check to see if it is fictional or is a true event or sadly ...true EVENTS! If you like autobiographical books or biographical as I do, always look for the copyright. Also, get the sample first. If you do not like fiction then you need not pay for it!!	0
I used it for a week and half and it seem to work as described. I don't know how well its going to work for over a long period of time, but it is cheap so it probably wouldn't last that long. No leakage of air or anything yet. It was the right size for me and I am 5'2, it might be small if your over 6' I'd imagine. Anyways, I recommend it to people who are looking for a temporary place to sleep.	1
I heard they had produced a cd of King Kong. I decided to check it out on the net. I was more than completely satisfied with what I had heard. I plan to purchase the cd and enjoy it for the rest of my life. I brought my young teen-age daughter over to hear it, to my surprise she enjoyed it as well.	1
"Too many books that purport to teach you Yiddish treat it as either a joke or a relic. Prof. Weinreich's ""College Yiddish"" treats Yiddish as a living, expressive and literary language, not as a compendium of phrases to say to your bubbe when she visits, or as a collection of cursewords. The book consists of 30 graded lessons, each based on a text which covers some aspect of Jewish life, culture and history, and especially of the Jewish communities of central and eastern Europe for whom Yiddish was a bond. At the end of the book is an excellent precis of Yiddish grammar. But this book isn't ""dry as dust,"" either: Prof. Weinreich takes Jewish humor as seriously as he does Jewish culture and literature! Very highly recommended."	1
Grateful I stumbled upon this book. A fantastic read. Timeless and incredibly thought provoking.If the summary grabs you at all, give it a chance.	1
Tom Shales and James Andrew Miller seemingly provided an opportunity for free therapy sessions to all former and current SNL staffers. The whining, moaning and venting about how hard their lives are is more laughable than most of the SNL skits they've ever performed in.The book provided nothing interesting in how the show actually operates. Sniping at one another seems to be the only reason for most cast member to even agree to be interviewed for the book. Missed opportunities by not interviewing lesser cast members (though they might have turned down the authors) could have painted a complete other picture.The special on Biography (on A&E) was more interesting than this book - and was only an hour. Catch that instead.	0
I've read many of the works published on the sinking of the White Star liner, Titanic, and I have to say this is, without doubt, one of the poorest yet. Pellegrino obviously is trying for emotional meditative discourse, but failing that, ends up making up out of whole cloth entire conversations and scenarios. Titanic was *not* the first ship to use the SOS call. The inclusion of the Frank Towers myth is a dead giveaway that Pellegrino picks and chooses his myths, without bothering with such inanities as fact-checking. If it's entertainment and an emotional response you're after, go see Cameron's movie. If it's history you want, better to stick with other, far better, far more accurate works.	0
"This movie plays as if it was directed by the camera.It looks cheap is hopelessly incoherent.Stick with ""Close Encounters""."	0
I was looking forward to reading this since all the reviews were so positive. What a disappointment! It's a story that really goes nowhere.--Just when you think something may happen, it doesn't and your left with a rambling tale of a boy's life. I did not find it clever or quotable. I consider myself a reader and found nothing in this book that stayed with me. I was happy to finish it just because I'm one of those people that hates to Not finish a book once i've started it. Thank God it wasn't a long book. That's the only good thing I can say about it.	0
"Give me a break. The writing was lousy, the concepts and ideas were questionable...sorry, but one star is pushing this book.Orwell underestimated the human animal and its tenacity in the face of oppression...his complete and utter takeover of society w/ ""Big Brother"" just wouldn't last, even if it could happen.People have oral histories...ones you cannot erradicate...just ask various peoples around the world who survived oppression despite attempts at stopping their stories and changing their cultures.Let Orwell's work die as a curiosity..."	0
Apart from shrinking core of diehard fans, who is going to buy this? Most of the songs appear on other albums, the liner notes are schmaltzy, the sound quality is not that hot, and BS's voice sounds worn and tired.If she really cared, she would tour with all new songs and sing like she was happy to be there and NOT TALK ABOUT POLITICS. :)For those of you unsure as to whether or not to buy the CD, wait a month and it will be in the cutout bin.I give this 2 stars in honor of the late Mr. Peter Matz, thanked by BS in the liner notes in her usual pompous way.	0
Clay Goes Beyond!Beyond anything you heard on AI, Clay shows his real talent. 'The Way' gave me goosebumps in the same way that his rendition of 'This is the Night' did when I first heard him sing it. Hopefully, he is hear to stay. I love his voice. If you stumble a bit on the first song, keep listening. It is the only one that is tentative in my opinion.	1
"Everything that needs to be said was said in ""Into Thin Air"" and ""The Climb."""	0
I didn't like the book so much. The author put to much detail about one person, Kit. I knew all of the background information about Kit and everything she owned. But when Hanna Tupper was introduced I hardly knew anything about her. The author also didn't write in any excitement in the story. Everyone was just plain everyday individuals that did everyday things, like cleaning and spinning wool, making meals, cleaning the house and making clothes. It would have been interesting if the author had put Kit or some other character on an adventure or made it a fiction not a historical fiction. I don't know anyone who would like to read a book about just everyday, ordinary people, that are living ordinary lives. I want to read a book about some adventure or action.	0
I love soad and I was really looking forward to the followup. I heard chop suey on the radio and I got it the same week it came out. While the songs are very well written, it lacks the flow and the energy from the first album. Perhaps I had listened to the debut a bit too much, but I felt they took a little too much time with this one.	0
"Clay Aiken has a voice that touches my heart and soothes my soul. I love every song on this CD, so it's a tough call to name a favorite when they all gave me chills...and a few brought tears to my eyes. ""Run To Me"" is so very haunting and beautiful, and ""Measure of a Man"" and ""The Way"" are both touching and tender and exquisitely performed. An awesome debut, well worth the wait."	1
This story of a Cantonese family in Hong Kong is filled with warmth and humor. It tracks the relationship between Wallace, a clever young man of Portuguese-Cantonese descent, and the family's shrewd, miserly, tyrannical patriarch. Perhaps it's a bit of a fairy tale that works out too smoothly in the end. But Mo writes so well about families - and is so good at capturing the magic of people finding somewhat unexpectedly that they love each other - that it doesn't matter. The scenes between Wallace and his surprisingly resourceful wife May Ling -- and between Wallace and his beloved nephews -- are simply a joy to read.	1
This is an excellent book for those who wish to travel to Laos, or even those who wish to begin learning lao in small steps. I purchased this book in order to learn the language at a quicker and more simplified pace. It contains not only basic phrases that one might need to know in order to conduct ones self in the main parts of Laos but also be able to learn some of the country's culture as well. Even though studying an entirely new language can be laborious, Mr. Cummings has made it easy for anyone to be bilingual, even multi-lingual.	1
For the money ~ I was very disappointed in these earring and I wrote to the seller right a way.I had to go away on a family reunion but I did not even bring them ~ they are not classey looking at all. For Chalcedony I was so sadly let down. Think Twice is my advice! Lynn C. ~ South Jersey, N. J.	0
"Musiq did it again every song on here i like to some sort but my favorite, favorite , is ""Momentinlife"" with kindred and cee-loguiness!!!I recommend this to all the ""real musiq Lovers""I agree with the other person who said that Kindred was overlooked cause that was the truth. They did not get the credit that was due. come on yall lets get the Real Artist to the top cause that is where Real music Lives and is created. They Deserve it! But anyway Musiq Wonderful job it just gets better and better."	1
While the film includes some interesting visuals, it is bogged down by rather heavy-handed Catholic theology. If you don't subscribe to such beliefs, like me, you find yourself unable to care about the plot or see it as worth your effort to understand. All in all, I was rather bored by the end and found myself looking at the clock. It felt like I was watching the Catholic equivalent of the cheesy Protestant _Left Behind_ series.	0
After about a year of use, ZR 40 started eating tapes. Do a google search on the topic, there are hundreds of people with the same problem. 'Remove Cassette' and 'Eject' (use those as keywords combined with 'Canon ZR' to view message boards postings) will appear on the screen, and that's the end of the toy.	0

I have two sandisk cruzer flash drives, and i have to say, they're great. The first one i got has been with me for years, and it's still working great.The retractable usb connector elliminates the need of a cap, so you never have to worry about loosing it. The materials are very high quality, and the U3 software is usefull for some applications.In my opinion, this is the best usb flash drive out there.I actually started trusting sandisk after this, and went to the store to buy a sansa e260, wich is great too.	1

This is unlike the other books that i have read so far. the plot revolves around a bar and three best friends. They are good at their jobs,articulate and know what they want from life. But a crazy flat-mate, an affair with a superior and motherhood corode their friendship and their lives-almost. This book is about true friendship and how it can get you through the day and lives problems big or small. A good read that cannot be put down.	1
basicall a rip off of the some of the earlier renissance works, ie: decameron, cantebury tales, inferno, candid, etc... good for the high school student trying to organize his mind.	0
"I tried online 'live'support and asked for the kit to fix the ""out of paper"" problem, but they put me through a bunch of questions about it that took so long that I ran out of time. It does not seem to be as simple as contacting them and having them send out a kit."	0
I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!	1
Very sturdy and does a good job of holding my flute like it's supposed to. I would definitely recommend this product.	1
These books are flat out great. The author of the first and 3rd book is somewhat prone to typos, but aside from that these books just flat out rock. They did an impressive job of filling in the back story for Master Chief (John) and what became of the other Spartans before the start of the first Halo game. The recap of the events that transpired in Halo was wonderful too. Then the kicker; in the 3rd book there's a few Spartans left? What a way to lead up to Halo 2. Simply amazing stuff here, if you're a fan of the series anyhow but then again anyone reading this is bound to be.	1
The amp arrived and looked great for a refurbished unit. The price could not be beat. However my unit only ran for about ten minutes before the circuits began shutting off and on. So I let J&R Music World know about the problem and was told to return it at their cost. I received an emailed ups label and dropped it off to go out next day. I got a fast response from J&R and a proper credit was made. So although I didn't get a working amplifier, I did get the kind of service that would allow me to shop with confidence on Amazon.com .	0
I haven't been able to get into it ...read only a bit and it hasn't held my attention...maybe I'll try again sometime... I know it is supposed to be like a classic so try it ....	0

"Zojirushi NS-ZCC10 5-1/2-Cup Neuro Fuzzy Rice Cooker and Warmer, Premium WhiteThis unit replaces a ""National"" rice cooker I purchased 15 years ago. This one looks like it's younger sibling. Neuro Fuzzy logic makes cooking rice so easy. No complaints. I really like the little handles on the pot. Please read the instructions, a cup of rice, their cup is different from a standard measuring cup. If you keep it plugged in, you won't have to worry about the battery.AlHawaii"	1
I bought these specifically because I missed using pampers after they introduced the Dry Max Technology into their cruisers. I thought I would try the baby dry on my son since it says nothing about dry max on the box. It also says overnight on the package, so I thought it would be a little more absorbent. I have been very satisfied with this diaper and do expect to buy more after this huge box is gone.	1
"If you must have Speak and Spell ( which is quite good, despite being very lightweight, fluffy, lyrically empty early-eighties synth-pop ) do yourself a favour and spend the extra money on the import version. The US version pales in comparison to the original Uk version. There is a great song ( Sometimes I Wish I Was Dead, which is not as depressing as its title would suggest ) that was left off the US pressing, and the extra time was taken up by the inclusion of the 12"" remix of Just Can't Get Enough (which is better in its original 7"" mix anyway - over six minutes of Just Can't Get Enough is, well, too much of enough ). There are also a few great b-sides that are on the UK version of the cd."	0

Has the best variety of Hot Wheels and Matchbox cars as well as other diecast toy vehicles. Easy to use and understand. I highly recommend this book.	1
After all the good reviews I read of this book I thought I would love it. Usually I enjoy biographies. I found that this book is written in a style that makes the story a bit difficult to follow. I gave it my best shot but I did not enjoy it at all.	0
Typically while reading Chronicles in the bible, one tends to be overwhelmed and therefore come out of it with a less than exciting experience.Lynn Austin puts you right smack into the scenes. You are not reading about the past, you are living it, feeling it, practically smelling it (smoke, incense, etc.); it is that real.Many times, I put the book down and picked up the bible for verification of characters, lineage, etc....it was all there.Get to know your biblical kings in all their glory (or lack thereof). Love them or hate them, you will love the book. I ordered the second one the minute I finished the first.You won't be disappointed.	1
An inspiring depiction of a woman. I received this from my mother in Junior High School, I only read this recently. I wish I had read it sooner. I have sent this series to all my friends. I can't wait for the next book!	1
George and Lennie are very good friends. They are always doing things together and travel together. Lennie is the one who always makes trouble and Veorge always helps him. But now, Lennie just causes a serious problem that Veorge even can't help. Lennie is a huge guy, has a ind of a young child, and George is small and quick. Two of them are totally the opposite, not only the way they look, and the way they act, but they have a same dream. I like this book and I will recommend you to read it, because it is great and it will always give you surprise. Also, you will learn their friendship.	1
The reviewer below is right on the money. In fact, the guitar solo he mentioned is, IMHO, the ALL-TIME WORST GUITAR SOLO ON RECORD! It's an unfortunate combination of impossibly awful taste and complete incompatibility with the song. (Actually there are TWO concurrent solos, each stepping all over the other, to make it even more obnoxious.) I'd love to be able to separate the tracks to pull the ugliness out and enjoy the music. Otherwise, some fine grooves though, and soulful singing from Mr. Williams...	1
We are fans of Frommer's Guide books from previous trips and choose this book from Amazon.com without reviewing it the old fashioned way - browsing through the pages/sections. Too late we discovered the book barely mentioned our destination points: Pretoria (Tshwane), and a private game reserve bordering Kruger National Park. We missed the 'where to dine' suggestions and places of interest in/near Pretoria, which have been particularly helpful in the past.In addition, we found at least one map reference that sent the reader to a page that had no corresponding text to the map cross reference. We ended up leaving the book at home.	0
"Filmed in Czechoslovakia, with a cast that seems perfectly suited physically to the James' novel's descriptions, Turn of the Screw has the added advantage of Britten's ""regulars"" (Peter Pears et al) providing the music to which the actors flawlessly lipsynch. The atmosphere evoked visually and musically does full service to both the intricacies and shading of the opera, and to the psychological ambiguities of the plot and characters. Truly one of the best filmed, sung, and acted opera videos in recent memory."	1
If I could I would give this zero stars. But I can't so I will only give it one. This band is call metal. What's so metal about them? Have people you lsiten to them heard a really metal band? A really metal band puts far more into there music then this. I can't stand Nu-Metal.	0
I am fortunate enough to have Lake Douglas as an instructor. He has forgotten more about landscape architecture than most people will ever know. I love going to his class because he has a genuine passion for the subject and almost limitless knowledge. Buy this book. You won't be disappointed.	1
"The first chapter is: ""God Made Me"". If you are of the eminently rational and obviously authentic mindset that Superman doesn't exist and did not save Gotham City from certain destruction, don't expose your kids to this nonsense. The cultists can't resist an opportunity to brainwash the innocent. This ""free"" e-book is like a Trojan horse. Take a look inside before you allow it to poison your Android device.And, if you are a cultist, please get this book. It may be of genuine assistance in brainwashing your naive and innocent children into your particular cult. Just tell them: Superman made me. Then tell them that Superman, the Easter Bunny, Allah, Jebus and the Flying Spaghetti Monster and all related fictitious supernatural entities are REAL, and DEMAND belief or you'll end up boiling in a hot pan of frying oil for all eternity. Along with some leeks, large butterfly shrimp, and potentially crushed garlic.Have I made my point yet?Don't brainwash your kids."	0
Is this really Ms. Spencer's first novel? This was an outstanding read. I had to remember at times that this was being written by a woman. She did a wonderful job with the writing and with all of the characters. We got to know the characters without them becoming to boring or getting too much information on them. What an ending too!! I am anxiously awaiting her next book. Much success and blessings in all your endeavors. Peace!!	1
This is new technology, what can we say? It might have its occasional bugs (not being able to get songs in a few days) but these are things that can be overlooked. Its new for crying out loud! The best way to get these bugs ironed out is by supporting the product and giving Sony feedback. The interface of this product is excellent and simple...a button and a tiny LCD screen. If you don't know how to use this then...technology isn't your buddy I guess. As far as coverage and the speed in which certain radio stations provide feedback is the sole responsiblity of that station for the most part (most stations take 24 hours to get a song. others might take maybe 10 minutes or so), and NPR support would be very much appreciated. Not every location on the surface of the earth is supported (yet) but as far as I'm concerned an e-mail request to Sony could help to do the trick. Overall, the product is great and it is a great Sony investment.	1
"This is a great book, especially if you actually understand the symbolism. However, I bought it ""used and in good shape."" It was NOT in good shape. The last probably 25 or so pages looked like a dog had chewed it to shreds. I could read some of the pages, but others were completely confusing without the other half. I would recommend this book, but I would not recommend that you buy it used."	0
The author of this book hates freedom and his book is unsupported by the Constitution and the Bill of Rights.	0
"So why did people who bought this buy it? Because Clay is ""cute""? Because he won a national karaoke search and everybody feels they must buy this because the media hyped it up so much? Because a bunch of writers and music producers (including Simon Cowell!)rushed him into the studio to sing over a bunch of generic songs written before he even appeared on TV? Or because he has a good voice? Do people who buy this kind of drivel EVER care about the music underneath it all?? Or the fact that this guy basically had nothing to do with the production or writing of this lame material? Have you actually listened to these laughable lyrics? DON'T YOU KNOW HOW MANY GREAT ARTISTS YOU'RE MISSING OUT ON BECAUSE YOU THINK THIS GUY IS CUTE AND HAS A NICE VOICE???"	0
"My least favorite Shakespeare--long, tedious, boring and highly distasteful.

A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas.The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents.	0
"I just love Pampers Swaddlers and I've used them for both babies. But these Pampers Baby-Dry sz 3 are just worthless! Every little wee-wee just balloons the diaper and subsequent wee-wees leak out. Diaper gets ""full"" way too easily, then when we pick her up and hold her it squishes out (number 1 squeezes out and wets all of our clothes). Just no good. Hubby doesn't get upset at much, but he is just hugely frustrated about these. We're going through 3x as many diapers, at least, as we did when using Huggies. So back to Huggies it is."	0
Nineteen Eighty-Four remains the popular watchword for invasion of privacy fifty years after its publication. The novel can be read as a warning against the malign personalization that could be possible with a systematic technological attack on privacy. `The worst thing in the world,' says the hero's torturer, `varies from individual to individual.' The evil state in 1984 sought to control mindspace and to dictate identity to its subjects. ``The command of the old despotisms was ``thou shalt not''. The command of the totalitarianisms was ``Thou shalt''. Our command is: ``*Thou art*.''	1
The rating is not for the show but for the delay. Why is it taking so long to get these seasons of one of the best TV shows of all time to DVD? What do we have to do? We want to all go about this in a legal way but it seems that we are being pushed to illegal means in order to obtain these shows. I'm sure I could get them from numerous vendors throughout Thailand. It would not surprise me if these two seasons are already available for download off the internet. But some of us want to spend our money legally. And thanks to Fox it seems like we may never be able to.	0

The author states this is a fictional work with some incidents and characters based on historical fact. As a non-Catholic, I found the book very interesting; die-hard Catholics might be offended by it.Colin Michener is the papal secretary to his mentor and pope, Clement XV. Clement keeps returning to the private papal archives more and more because something bothers him. He sends Colin on a journey that leads him to more and more trouble and mystery. Clement's archrival Alberti Valendrea, papal secretary of state, and his accomplice, Paolo Ambrosi, do nothing to promote peace and harmony...just death and a return to the dark ages of the church. The third secret reveals surprising directives that popes have been ignoring for years.	1
I had this game for almost a week before I sold it to EB Games (when they were still buying used PC games). If you're looking for more of Rome: Total War just get the expansion pack, not this. The graphics are nice, but the gameplay is so limited that I felt like I was watching someone else play. The units were way too small and the controls weren't very fluid. Having never been a fan of stragedy games before, I went on the prowl for some after Medieval: Total War but found that Total War games are the only ones I like. Some others like the technical aspects of campaigning in other games, but I'm more of a battle map player. So if you loved Total War, stick with it. Stay away from similiar games.	0
I purchased this rice cooker during a promoting Amazon had, which saved me $50, and it was the brand that I wanted. It's very easy to use; either use the green cup (for pre-sifted rice) or the clear cup (for regular rice), add water, and press the start button.This rice cooker live up to all its claims, and delivers the goods. If you have no special need in timers, cooking porridge or brown rice, then this rice cooker is overkill (big time) and you can purchase a less expensive model (such as the Zojirushi NS-MYC10 (5 cup model), or the NS-MYC18 model (10 cup)).The only annoyance (very minor), was each time you started to cook, this rice cooker has to make a sound (either a beep, or twinkle-twinkle little star). I haven't found a way to make it silent when it starts or ends cooking (without beeping or playing a melody). A minor annoyance, but other than that this is a very good rice cooker.	1
BORING. I started to read about the Dow Theory with old fashioned charts of defunct stocks. There are supplements to the text to bring in modern stocks, but maybe one should retire this book.	0
Nope it doesn't replace a tome costing much more. Yes it does solve all those annoying ZIP confusions and the Area Code look ups are excellent. Good value.	1
The High Life Cannabis Cup 2005 is the highlight of my year. Over the past few years I always come back broke. This year I wanted to take home more. After careful selection I bought a Buddy that uses magnets to clean bongs. It cost ten dollars. I also bought this book because it looked good. I also bought a book called Hashish. I recommend this book for growing information and Hashish for the history. I enjoyed reading this book at the cup and I am very sure you will also.	1
A year ago, for schoolwork I had a choice to read this book, and I took it. Everyone said they're siblings said it was boring. Not so!!This was an excellent book, for pleasure reading and for learning about Colonial America. An great book for teachers to read with their students, too. Masterfully writen, a great book. I reccomend it.	1

In fact I could replace the ""hilarious/beautiful"" with just about any other adjective, and it would explain as much."	1
The proofs are well structured and easy to follow. The techniques used in the proofs lend themselves for use in other situations. A lot of information is embeded in the exercises which keep the students alert and focused and at the same time saves time and space. A good book for undergraduates in mathematical analysis.	1
We were among the unlucky buyers who happened to receive a dud. The airbed had a gash at the bottom, which we patched. But it also leaked at the seams and our attempts to patch that did not work. We returned it, unslept-on -- no easy task, since we were required to return the manufacturer's box, and of course we could not get the deflated airbed back into it, so we had to find a box big enough to hold both the deflated airbed and the manufacturer's box.	0
My first Kindle e-book (see also free book) and I loved it. A classic story full of adventure, intrigue, romance and mystery. Dumas had it down.	1
I totally disagree with the reviewer from Hongkong who must have been writing about some other book when she portrayed Infatuation as funny and sexy, with witty dialogues and hot passion. As it happens, most of the book is devoted to a character analysis of Judith. In a nut shell, Judith knows that she is an ugly duckling with incredible brain power. We don't see any real attraction developing between Luke and Judith until the last quarter of the book. And then when it does, the author's analysis of Judith is vindicated for she is accepted by Luke because of her brainy self rather than her looks. The most tragicomedical line of the book must be when Luke agrees with Judith that she is not beautiful. Disappointingly for me, just when I'm getting interested in the story in the last quarter of the book, the plot reaches its climax and comes to an end. The story is dry and tends to drag on. I must say that the writing is good as can be expected from Charlotte Lamb. I gave it two stars.	0
I have ordered this item 3 times, while the shape makes cutting easier than normal end cutters such as channel lock the quality of the metal blade is not good. The item listing claims to be for heavy use and all3 I ordered chipped within a couple days of use making the tool useless.	0
Tried to play on two different Blu-ray players and it simply would not play. I could only get it to play on my computer. No good.	0
Was pleasantly surprised by the quality of these movies. Thought maybe they would be sub pr because there were so many for such a great price. Actually some real gems and some great actors.	1
I honestly didn't think the CD would be as good as it is. I did expect great, but this is awesome. First time I have listened to a CD all the way through. Even if he didn't write the songs, he sounds like he means every word. Excellent Album!!! KEEP IT UP CLAY!	1
There is a known issue with this printer when printing PDFs. If you scan an image to a PDF and then attempt to print the PDF the printer spool crashes. Not only do you lose access to this printer but you also lose access to any other printer. The problem occurs with all Windows OSs but happens on a regular basis with Vista. Loaded several different print drivers recommended by HP but nothing worked. So proceed with caution.	0
first the acting was so so so bad the movie, this is what i have to say ?but they get E for effort.	0
actually, an intriguing and literally epic idea. especially when I first read it, years ago, the idea of a female protagonist being the central figure not only of the story but of this stage in human, earthly development, was absolutely unique. I still find it so (I reread it)...	1
This fan is junk! The high speed didn't work to start, the lights don't shut off completly, which drains the battery, now it doesn't work at all! This is all only after 1 day of use!	0
It's not even a book. It's a photo copied ringed binder. I was surprised that Amazon marketed this as a ligitimate book published by a real publisher. It is an absolute joke.	0
Just a note: I tried to order this CD 05.12.2000 and had to cancel the order 22.01. after 4 delay notes. Process as such OK but 1-2 week delivery time is definitely optimistic... br, SK	0
The story is an ode to optimism, in spite of all. Is everything that happens in this world for the best? This is the main philosophical question addressed in this book, and Candide will try to prove you that.	1
I think this album is brilliant--awesome music!! Can't turn it off!!! Especially love Allegratango!!! Adiemus could sing to the sound of a washing machine and still sound good! Kudos!!!	1
The movie started out poorly and went down hill from there. I was waiting for it to get better and realized after 30 minutes it was only going to get worse. Stopped after 50 minutes. I just could not waste any more time on this movie. If you read reviews before watching a movie and there are this many bad reviews, don't watch.	0
There are parts in the book that start to bore you at times. T.H. White puts anachronisms to make it more interesting. The book was not very thrilling. The book can seem like it is never ending. But I'd say that this book is plain boring. It does have some adventure. I did not like it. I DONT RECCOMEND IT!	0
I purchased this climber/swing for my 2 year old twin daughters (a couple years ago). We have a large Cedar Works wooden play structure (highly recommended - no splinters!) purchased for their older brother but I thought they would need a smaller transitional climber. I was wrong. They wanted to play with big brother so went right for the wood play structure. They all still use this occasionally (ages 3.75, 3.75 and 7 now) but it is pretty small for them. I would suggest this for 1-3 year olds and only if they don't have an older sibling and bigger play structure to entice them. It is low to the ground, providing easy access to a new walker. It went together quickly and relatively easily and has held up very well, even with a 7 year old climbing on the roof.	1
I received the message that the U. S. government is hiding knowledge about what is beyond Earth's atmosphere. But all governments hide information from the masses of their people. What intrigued me was when the Sentinel Prime character said to the Optimus Prime character that they used to be gods and now they were called machines. I can relate to that statement. I am a descendant of a people that were performing high sciences at one point in time and now we are beasts of burden. Try to talk to a typical African person about science and see what you get. At best they'll say, how does this help me pay my bills? At worse they'll look at you like you have 2 heads.	1
I Plugged it in and it worked! First I tried another adapter & it didn't. Get it!	1
"I thought it was a superb read. It gives one the thought of dream to imagine themselves in their own world. It even reminded me of ""The Count of Monte Cristo"".....some. The Captian had a whole world, as well as a dream at his disposal. At times everyone no matter how high or low on the ladder they are, I think human beings need a special place like this story. A world to escape if you will."	1
The moment we watched this class, we knew, we didn't have to worry about childbirth anymore. 5 1/2 hours of essential information - and all the things we didn't know we didn't know! We became childbirth experts. Sheri, thank you for sharing this information in such an easy to understand and humorous way..	1
Figured it had potential to be funny. But is wasn't, and not very interesting. Can't reccomend this movie to anyone.	0
Mr. Marano's story wanders...and wanders... and wanders. His characters don't interact, and their development is pointless. This book is fully 200 pages too long. How long can the demons of Hell just sit and stir to existence and still keep our attention? Not 250 pages! There are some good moments, such as the Succubus inhabiting the mouse, but they are few and far between. The premise of this novel was so very promising -- I was very excited to read it. And I was let down completely. Mr. Marano, please, next time you have a good idea for a story, please write a story, not an epic adventure of style.	0
The transfer to digital format from the analog source includes all of the tape hiss on this disc. The content is great, but the background noise is too much on my system. I'd look for another title from OP and pass on this one.	0
I admit that I haven't finished the game yet but I've been enjoying playing it the last couple of days.Basically you command legions of the Romans. Archers, legionares, horsemen etc. On a terrain you have to beat the enemy.The units all have their special abilities, it's best to have spearman at the front to stop the enemy, horsemen to do quick attacks and archers for long range attack. Because of differences in heights it is important to have archers on higher positions.This all makes for fun. The graphis are really not great but I think most strategy-games players like me are not really interested in that. The sounds are fun and it has good historical accuracy with the names of all the tribes and their leaders.Worth the low price	1
"What in the world was Jax Peters Lowell thinking when she wrote Chapter 17, ""Rx for Health""? I cannot begin to express the fear and anxiety I felt when I saw Celebrex named as a drug that contains gluten. I stopped taking it immediately and began searching for a gluten-free alternative. I was so upset that all of my efforts as a celiac to live gluten-free were being undermined by my Celebrex. I had thought it was gluten-free! I found the website that Lowell mentions on page 394, Glutenfree Drugs.com, hoping to find a gluten-free alternative pain medication. Imagine my relief at seeing Celebrex on the list. I contacted Pfizer....no gluten! I Googled gluten and Celebrex.....NO Gluten! There are many responsible guides for celiacs. Lowell's book is certainly not one of them!"	0
I did not see a increase in supply with this product. I did notice that my pumped milk was more fatty after sitting in the fridge though. I was taking a double dose and took it round the clock, never missing a dose. I am past a year of breastfeeding and that may be why I did not see a boost. The alcohol taste is completely disgusting. I felt like my breath reaked of the alcohol afterwards and I just couldn't rid the taste from my mouth for several hours. If I try it again with future children, I will definately make sure I get the alcohol free version!	0
"I have no background in history and do not pretend to know what I'm talking about in that regard. However, when it comes to grammar, I know what I'm doing - and Howard Zinn, apparently, does not. The chapter of this book that I was given (Chapter 8: On Presidential Liars) was the most horrendously written piece of work I've ever read. Please make note of the fact that I read high school essays frequently; I thought I'd seen it all. Apparently, I was mistaken. According to Mr. Zinn, the American people have been ""deceived about"" much more than we thought, and should all ""deep anguish"" over it."	0

"""Bye, Bye, Bye"" is a good song, but I think more attention should be placed on the second track, the unreleased ""Could It Be You."" ""Could It Be You."" is a throwback to old school R&B music which really works for the group.If you love the song ""Bye, Bye, Bye,"" definitely buy this cd single, but if you want to hear something a little different, and in many ways better, buy this cd single for ""Could It Be You."""	1

The printer worked fine for about a year (no borderless prints though). After 15 months it started jamming every single time that I tried to print. I expected a ... repair bill (replace the roller) since the printer is out of warranty. According to HP, no 1215 printer can be repaired. Their only option is an exchange. They will send you a new HP 1215 for [price] (retail is [price]) and you return your old one. Apart from a ... coupon this is the ONLY option. Buyer beware.	0
You will hate yourself in the morning if you buy this Mr. Coffee coffeemaker. IT LEAKS - HORRIBLY!One full cup of water runs out of the base of the coffeemaker onto your counter top and down the front of the cabinet. I purchased two of these coffeemakers, one for my son and one for me. They both leaked. I threw mine in the trash and replaced it with a Cuisinart. Save yourself some grief - don't buy this coffeemaker.	0
This book is 3 words over and over again: MY LIFE IS BAD. 500 pages and that's all it says. It's exactly the same as any other book about a poor family with an irresponsible father and a child who manages to be alright (Angela's Ashes, Black Boy, Riding in Cars With Boys) the only difference is - THIS ONE IS FICTION. Don't waste your time, money, or your sympathy on the most over praised book ever written.	0
Trust me, this film is not worth your time.In the first Robocop the violence was extreme and had a wickedly dark twist to it. Even in the second film there was at least some excellent action sequences. The third film, however, is just Hollywood cashing in on a successful series!The plot is both simple and see through and the characters lack any real depth. Where before RoboCop was a lone ranger style character, who we feel sorry for due to his situation, he is now merely just another comic book hero.A lesson in how to ruin a good action/adventure film concept.	0
The picture thru the tivo unit was fuzzy. Maybe the Tivo unit is not designed to receive antenna TV. The Tivo unit made all chanels come in fuzzy. Also I didn't like that you could not use any of the functions without a Tivo subscription, but it seems that without the monthly subscription the whole thing is useless. I am now very happy with a standard DVR that does not require a monthly subacription and works much like the old VCR used to do but without the tapes. The unit I ended up with is thebrite-View BV-980H Digital HD DVR (for Antenna and clear QAM use) ,with 320GB HDD Built-in, EPG Supported,Time Shifting - Black. However I do agree with the critiques of the Brite-View unit, there are some tricky quirks that take some getting use to.	0
I loved all three books. I had read the Shelters of Stone first as it was a gift, but thoroughly enjoyed going back to see where it all began. Amazing author.	1
Braden draws a connective thread in this work uniting the sacred taught wisdoms of the past, the science of modern times, and the lives we seek to live today into a congruent whole. The effect of his passion for answers, moments of puzzlement, and intense desire to help create an everlasting peace, illuminates pathways that can lift people from lives of confusion to lives of direction. Many of the concepts noted had before been free-standing models that Braden draws into a much bigger, stronger picture.	1
Anyone interested in Paganism, Witchcraft, or Wicca really should own this book. I cannot recommend it highly enough. It is fluff-free and academically, though not poorly, written.	1
I have purchased several of these battery packs and I am pleased with the quality of the item and the cost. They do not use original APC batteries but they seem to work well. Batteries are from different manufacturers and can both be different in the same unit. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars (the picture shows the original batteries from APC). So far, so good!	1
The software for this unit does not support Windows XP. The unit is not of much use without being able to interface with the computer.	0
"This was the first in the series, and i was ""hooked"" until I finished book#5. Amazing Bible based fiction. I was so encouraged when I saw the characters ""come to life"" with Ms. Autens' literary skills. Recommend all five as a very good read and study."	1
I used these in the hospital when my baby was born and they are great!Now I have them in my baby bag along with the formula bottles and I always have a clean nipple when we are out. I recommend them.	1
The Third Secret is a very good story; unfortunately its written in a mediocre manner. The plot is shallow and poorly developed and at times, obvious. Its more akin to the work of an amateur than a published author. Although Berry seems to have stumbled while penning this work, the editor has badly let the reader down; errors in prose, style and consistency are too numerous to mention.I suggest those who wish to read Berry's work wait for the paperback edition or visit their public library. The Third Secret is a poor waste of hard earned wages.	0
Helen Hunt was good, but what could her character have liked about Andrew McCarthy's character? At best he was annoying. And where was the comedy? Mocking someone for nearly drowning---how is that funny?The Amanda character was rather creepy.The best part was Helen Hunt singing Buffalo Gals like Donna Reed in It's a Wonderful Life. In fact the best parts of the movie were the scenes from It's a Wonderful Life.Not a movie I would recommend.	0
Do I like this CD? You bet I do! Like most of the reviewers here I play it everyday and have yet to tire of it. Clay's voice resonates its way right into your heart. However, the is one point that I would like to make here and that is - Regardless of whether Clay Aiken ever sings another song, records another album, wins or loses, receives another award, applause or accolade and regardless of whether he receives good or bad reviews, it in NO WAY diminishes from the Measure of this Man!!!!! He and his album are awesome! Clay stands alone and apart from the rest. Thank you Clay Aiken and Thank You God for this gifted and talented individual. I am sooooo grateful and I am eagerly awaiting your next and next and next albums. Way to Go Clay and Happy 25th Birthday!!!!!	1

This is a beautifully designed product. I'm using it to haul one road bike on the turnk of my Miata. All the other manufacturers said I'd have to install a trailer hitch to haul bikes on a Miata. This works great, leaves no marks, folds up nice and easy to store in my trunk while riding.	1
The beats on this CD are alot better than what No Limit has put out before. I just wish C Murder could get off Tupac's jock because he's got Tupacs flow all up in his mouth.	0
People must really be desperate these days. Just because pretentious jerks who write bad music reviews for Rolling Stone and Pitchfork say this is good, doesnt mean it'll make you super-cool if you say you like it too. M.I.A. is HORRIBLE.	0
"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"	0

es una excelente obra , es el inicio de una saga muy interesante. a pesar de ser una novela , su sentido hist√≥rico es completo, su adaptaci√≥n al contexto tambien, de verdad la recomiendo, a todas aquellas personas que os guste leer novelas, obras y escritos entre otros, reales o ficticios relacionados del siglo XI al siglo XVI.	1
Combining his wonderful characters with his subtle senseof humor, Zelazny has created another great work. In Lordof Light, Mahasamatman (drop the Maha- &amp; the -atman and call him Sam) opposes the technologically created Godsbased on the Hindu pantheon. Like an abstract painting, every time you read this book something new is seen, felt,or experienced. This book is another example of why Zelazny one of the greatest sci-fi writers of all time	1
I was saddened to find out that Jennifer Love Hewitt was cast to portray Audrey Hepburn. She had no right to even try to compare to Hepburn. It is a poor excuse for a biography and it angered me to see Hepburn's life so poorly portrayed.	0
I love this album. Just when you think you've heard everything in the Celtic meme, along comes a CD like this that is new and exciting.	1
Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one.	0
"This is a review for the ORIGINAL release of the book, not the reprinting...A majority of the writing seemed to be written by a child. Some stories aren't finished - on purpose - but its annoying, others are just down right silly. But then there are a couple ""classic"" stories, like famous urban legends that make up for some of those bad stories. In the end I'm disappointed in this book. I have such fond memories of it from my childhood, it's a shame I don't feel the same way about it anymore.For a more in depth review please visit my horror movie/book review blog in my profile"	0
"This film is shot beautifully and I liked the way the actors were allowed to meander around in their character to sort of ""make the movie themselves"" as they went along. Unfortunately the movie is made to be ""About"" the ""last days"" of Kurt Cobain. This movie is not accurate and falls short in paying ANY kind of tribute to the memory of Kurt. It distorts his memory if it does any thing which is sad. I enjoy the quiet scenes and all the mood shots, it's a neat reflective film and is actually comedic at times once you take away any reference there might be to Kurt Cobain. I had to MUTE the volume during the scene where the character tries to sing and play like Kurt. Other than that, like I said I like the way the film is shot and made and would have enjoyed it if it did not have something supposedly to do with Kurt Cobain. Any way, that's what I have to say."	0
Same story here! I have been using Pampers Swaddlers for a while before buying this after reading through the reviews. What a huge mistake! It never keeps my 4 month old baby dry, I have to keep changing it as soon as he pees. I'll never buy it again!!!	0

"John Steinback is famous for writing book that took place during the Great Depression. Steinback's book ""Of Mice and Men"" is about two men, Lennie and George ,trying to reach their dream of ""living off of the fat of the land"", in other words they want to own their own land, be their own boss. While trying to reach this goal they run into many problems. Lennie has a problem of touching soft things such as rabbits, and he ends up doin some bad things at Weed and at the new ranch.In my opinion I didn't like this book alot because John steinback likes to describe the setting and i couldn't really picture it very much. Also, the ending of this book was very tragic and sad. I would recommend this book to any age because its a classic story that many people have loved and still rememeber after they read it."	1
i love this harness as it makes it so easy to cary the IM7 around. just understand that with this harness, most of the speaker and the controls on top are not protected. the purpose of this harness is to make the IM7 transportable, no to completely protect it as the bag does.	1
I was happy with the book on how to draw but it is for an older child. I'm sure our granddaughter will be able to do the drawing, just not the reading. We will need to help her.	1
while this book is factually interesting, it is sometimes a little boring. The author drones on a little too much at times and I found myself skipping passages and sometimes whole pages just to make progress through the book. On the whole a good read which reflects how things were at the time of the Manson Murders but ultimately a little unsatisfactory, somehow.	1
I downloaded EZ Antivirus trial version from CA and Installed it on my laptop (XP Professional SP1). After installation the software started scanning automatically, which I allowed it to do and left my laptop alone. The laptop caught my attention when it started rebooting again and again. I realized my hard disk was also making a lot of noise.I went to CA's website and couldn't find any number to call. So I started web chat with their support. The support said that I might have installed the software with another anti-virus already working on my laptop. As per him, now only Microsoft can fix my problem. He said he would escalate the issue and copy me the email, which I'm still awaiting.To fix my hard disk I tried XP setup, Restore disks, and even reformatting the hard disk. Nothing works. I had to throw the hard disk.So just a friendly warning... stay away!!!	0
Brokaw's thesis is that a generation tested by (a) the Depression, and (b) WWII, rose to the challenge and deserves our respect and admiration. This may be true, but Brokaw does not prove it. His book lacks the kind of rich specificity which would be convincing. For the various people he interviews, he gives us very little on how they survived the Depression. And as the book advances, we get less and less of the particulars of how the subjects experienced the war. The problem may be that there are too many subjects, or interviewees, to be handled with the thoroughness or depth that is finally convincing. At the end, we are left only with the warm feeling that they have survived, and we can all be grateful for that, but not with a sense that we have come finally to know them, especially in their past, and how that past has shaped them, which is, after all, the point of the book.	0
Generally, it and its wall wart just adds useless clutter. Doesn't hold much charge (might double the life of the average cell phone). Three or four times as large and heavy as the average cell phone. Not much in the way of uses: most of the time, you're going to be near an electric socket, a usb port or a car's cigarette lighter recepticle, so might as well just get the appropriate wires.	0
This book is a series of photos depicting a baby and a grandpa sharing an activity such as painting or eating. My two-year-old daughter loves going through page by page and naming each activity. My problem is that, except for one Asian, all of the babies and grandpas are white. It doesn't reflect the ethnic mix of America at all. I don't want my daughter assuming that all grandpas look the same. It bothers me every time we read it.	0

i hope this review finds it's way to the write place..I enjoyed this book/found it thought provoking and moving<sprinkled with a fair bit of humor and real life drama. One truly gets the impact of the trials and tribulations of a muscians journey.	1
I love this book! I'm trying to teach myself, and this book manages to make the information so interesting that it's easier to remember. Sometimes I can't wait to get to the next chapter.I especially like the way the author has managed to present core concepts in a simplified version before expanding on them. It's a lot easier to understand the complexities after you have a vision of the overall concept inscribed in your brain.I also like the way the author has alternated discussion of the basic facts with discussion of methods and experimental results. It breaks up the monotony of fact after fact. And the exhaustive references appear to be up to date considering the date of publication.My only criticism is that the book deserved better copy editing and/or proofreading. There are sometimes unnecessary repetitions and typographical errors. However, these small faults don't detract significantly from the overall merit of the book.	1
Great product and even better price. If you compare to Costco, Target, etc. you will not find a deal better than this.	1
"Very humorous, although I would have liked a little more between the sheets. Okay plot, but the characters were likable enough for me to recommend it for a ""quick"" read. Also, let me recommend one I just finished, The Color of Revenge. Hot, hot, hot!"	1
"I read the other reviews for this title & couldn't help noticing something. This product is also available in numerous other languages which are also sold on Amazon.com I found it odd how the same exact product (but for another language) could receive 4 &5 stars - while this one recieved only 1. Strange indeed - so, I had to check it out. The product is excellent, and it does what it says - it get's you ""speaking"" the language. My daughter actually had one of the CD-ROM's contained in this box set - ""Who is Oscar Lake"" and I'm not kidding when I tell you it cost $$! Imagine my surprise when I opned up the package and saw this title inside. How anyone could anyone knock a software title that cost them $$ - but has a value of $$$, is beyond me. Combined in this set are over 3,000 words & phrases - if learning these can't get you speaking a new language, I don't know what can. After looking at other programs I strongly believe that for the money - there isn't a better program around."	1
I bought this for my daughters history class and when she was writing her paper , we discovered that this copy had no publisher, no date of publication , and when she called the company, they had no further info. She had to explain this to her very to the book instructor . I really think it should not be sold. Next time I will look more carefully when I shop for other than text books	0
This book will not offend the non-catholic like others may. Best overall explanation of misunderstood beliefs about the church I have read.

If you are planing on taking that camera on vacation you need another battery and this thing is cheap enough to make the decision a no brainer!You know it is true! You will get to having SO MUCH FUN and forget that your camera has been working from sun up to sun down and now you have no photos of you and that special someone dancing at the cantina! You have no pictures of the lightshow, fireworks or anything else that happened after 9:34pm. The moment that your camera died!Charge both batteries, keep one in the case and one in the camera. Problem solved!	1
Well, it was very romantic and very imaginative, totally complicated and fantastic to analyze, very emotional. I'm touched deeply with Shakespeare.	1
"Many think that this album is inferior compared to other Cream albums. This is my favorite Cream album, Clapton's guitar work is beyond compare. ""Spoonful"", ""I Feel Free"" and ""Sweet Wine"" show Clapton's talent as a top guitarist as well as his talent as a blues musician on blues songs ""Sleepy Time Time"", ""I'm So Glad"" and ""Cats Squirrel"" as well as his lead vocal on ""Four until Late."" Gingers drumming is also at its peak on his showpiece ""Toad"" as well as doing more than keeping time on ""Sweet Wine"" and others. Jack Bruce's range as a vocalist combined with his talent as a bass and harmonica player are shown on this album more than on any other Cream Album. Though many of the songs aren't original, they sound like no other band when coming from Cream. I would take this album over any other made by Cream, or any other band!"	1
"Installing one of these printers is always a miserable experience. The install program constantly tries to load USB printing support FOR WINDOWS 98, leading to an ""unrecognized object"". The only way to get a working install on the first try is if you have already installed some other kind -any kind- of USB printer in the past.Doesn't work well with network print servers or USB switches.Extremely finicky as to which USB cable it will work with, need to have 2 or 3 cables on hand to find one it will accept. Of course HP doesn't provide one.I don't have time for this kind of nonsense every time one of my users needs a new printer, and have switched to Brother."	0

I too read this book quickly, staying up one night until 2 or 3 in the morning, and I was riveted. I agree that the account of the aftermath was drawn out and took away from the description of the crime itself, but I can appreciate the relief that came from sharing that experience.A couple of weeks after reading the book I had a chance encounter with Jeanine and Tom Cummins' mother - it was a complete coincidence that I came to realize who she was. The book had quite an impact on me, and meeting someone face to face who was so intimately involved forever etched this story in my mind.It's a stark reminder that evil does exist, that chance encounters can change your life forever, that you should trust your instincts and listen to your mother, and that only the good die young.	1

DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION!! It is full of typos, missing information in problems, mislabeled diagrams, and wrong answers! I spoke with PR and they said that, yes, indeed that is correct, but the 2002 edition has been corrected. Can you imagine what I went through while studying? I was second guessing myself left and right. I finally realized that, no, I do what I'm doing, it's the book that was wrong.Please don't buy this 2000 edition, it is a waste of your time and money. The 2002 edition ought to be much better, and probably quite a good study guide. I, however, have not seen it and do not know for sure, but PR should be a fairly respectable test prep. company.Happy GREs...hahaha	0
Marie Curie's youngest daughter Eve has given us a gift by writing this biography of her mother. Eve manages to let us into her mother's private world while inspiring our full respect of her privacy. Madame Curie and her husband Pierre exemplify the meaning of the word integrity - a rarity, especially in our culture of constantly searching for fame and wealth at all cost. I will read this book multiple times like visiting a friend and learning a bit more about this remarkable person each time.	1
Their first album was better. This a good CD, but it lacks the complete insanity of the first one (Sugar, Ddevil, Darts...). The band is starting to head in a more mainstream direction. This CD is good, but I'm worried that they will become progressively more poppish with each album.There are alot of songs on Toxicity, such as Science, that succeed only because of one small section. Science would be a pretty boring song if it weren't for that awesome eastern sounding bit. The songs on the first album didn't need to be patched up to sound cool; they were brilliant to start with.If you don't have the first CD and want to buy Toxicity, do yourself a favor and get the first one instead. Only buy this if, like me, you really like the first one and want more.	1
"I appreciate the favorable comments made by all of the reviewers. For the record, however, in response to Peter George: my note on Stonewall Jackson accurately observes that the Confederate forces under his command repulsed the Union army at the first Bull Run and forced their retreat to Washington. I elsewhere add (chapter V, note 14) that J. E. Johnston commanded all Confederate forces in the battle. Peter Bridges also seems to object that my notes are too detailed, even ""demeaning"" to ""educated Penguin readers,"" yet that my note re. Bailie Jarvie is not detailed enough. I can only reply that my notes are intended to aid precisely those undergraduates who require them, not the pedants who are perfectly entitled to ignore them."	1
While I absolutely love the four agreements and return to the original book often, I found the companion book to be completely unnecessary. The writing style was poor and rambled in circles, constantly repeating itself. There was no new information at all. I seemed to me to be a way to get a little more money out of the concept - shocking considering the author.I did enjoy the last few pages of personal examples from people who had incorporated the four agreements into their lives.If you have the four agreements original book, you don't need this one and if you don't then skip this one and get the original.	0
Just FYI....the element heats up fine, but does not seem to connect to my mug/cup to heat the liquid contents. I use it at work to keep my cup of tea warm. A previous one I had (not same manufacturer) died on me and figured a cup/mug warmer most are all alike. I bought the one with the best responses, go figure. This one barely keeps the contents warm, heat is barely recognizable. Sorry does not work well for me.	0
Jennifer Love Hewitt is clearly not Audrey Hepburn, she doesn't even come close, but, I will concede that she did a great job at producing and starring in this made-for-TV-movie. It takes us from Audrey's childhood all the way to one of her many defining moments - the filming of Breakfast At Tiffany's.It really is a pleasant film to watch. Although the script can be slow at times, I feel that it honors Audrey's memory. Even her son approved of this biography.Ultimately, I'd like to say to those who bash Ms. Hewitt for starring in this bio-pic, I'm glad that she used the fame she has to introduce Audrey to a younger audience that possibly would have never learned about her otherwise.I give this movie four stars because of Emmy Rossum's incredible talents. I wish her and Ms. Hewitt many more successes.	1

As a skimmer who can usually finish a book in a few hours, this book was the exception. The plot was well contrived, the characters highly developed and the ending not expected. Superb!	1
I plugged this item into my laptop and nothing happened. No power- nothing.When I unplugged this adapter the negative metal ring from the plug stayed lodged inside of my computer, I had to remove it with needle nose pliers.I had to call the company 5 times before getting a rep on the phone as I was continually placed in automated limbo for about 15 per call. The rep actually admitted to me that this happens alot because the rings are too small and fit to tight in the computers.I was really looking forward to saving some dough. But this adapter was surprisingly worse the the original that came with the computer.They are sending me return authorization.	0
It's just a desperate attempt by two failing musicians. Both Kelly and Ozzy have been criticized for releasing this song! Why? Well because they absolutely butchered it! Now I will give Sharon that it was a smart move...but that's all. True, when you just look at what the song is it's a father & daughter song. But that id rather they had actually taken the time to write a new song. And I wonder what the other members of Black Sabbath think about the re-done Changes.Ozzy's music career is in jeopardy and Kelly's was D.O.A. almost from square one. This is just a last stitch effort for two failing artist.I honestly think this is the last song these two will do together.Lastly, Mtv can go to hell for making them both look like complete fools. I hope that this isn't the end of Ozzman. (I do hope it's the end of Kelly though)	0
We bought this thinking our kids would love it. They did love painting. But the problem came when we tried to wash it off. We cleaned it about 30 minutes after the kids started and we had to get out the pressure washer. It took about an hour to clean up. It was by far the worst clean up. It does not come off that easily. the regular hose did nothing to get it off.	0

"Colorless, poorly written collection of interviews with WWII vets held together by shaky thesis.The title refers of course to the Americans who fought WWII and prospered in post-war America. While taking nothing away from accomplishments, why are they the ""greatest generation?"" No generation of Americans has ever failed to answer the call to arms and perform in less than spectacular fashion. Are the Americans who fought the Germans and Japanese somehow superior to those who fought in WWI or Vietnam, or the Civil War? Did it take more courage to parachute into France than Vietnam?Let's not forget that the WWII generation also returned home at a time of unprecedented growth and oppurtunity. Not so for vets of other wars, especially vets of WWI and Vietnam.I suggest that anyone interested in books of this type try ""Citizen Soldiers,"" or ""D-day,"" by Stephen Ambrose, or any one of the scores of far superior books offering accounts of WWII vets."	0
While the subject of this story intrigued me it also really disturbed me at the same time. I think it was an important read. Big Brother, here we are. I won't say you'll have fun from reading this book but I will say you will learn a thing or two about our world and where we are going.	1
I did not realize that I needed a PCI Port card and the web site did not indicate this requirement nor that this card was AGI. My son pointed it out to me after I ordered the card. When I contacted Tiger Direct, they did not know that it needed an AGI slot. They told me to call the Distributor - Diamond, who after a 35 minute wait on hold, said it was not his product (it was). When the card arrived and I confirmed that it was not PCI, I was able to return it and get a full refund. It was a hassle taking the box to be returned. I would have preferred to know about this before I ordered it.	0
These dresses are simple and beautiful. They are easy to alter. They do run big though. The measurments that they provide for the dresses seem to be way off. Buy a smaller size than you think you need so you can avoid exchanges. The price per dress is reasonable. These dresses work for all body types.	1
I didn't expect to be overwhelmed by this book, thinking it would be the typical albeit entertaining murder-mystery novel. Instead I encountered an exceedingly well written story with a warm, likeable protagonist and a plot that truly keeps you wondering until the last chapter. After reading this novel, I have since sought out and read all of Lindsey's novels. If you like a good, gory thriller, you have to read this book.	1
Purchased this radiator 5 months ago. It fit perfectly and performed well for 5 months. The side tank seam started weeping last week. This week it is leaking a lot. I expected this to last much longer. I will purchase another brand next time or go to a junk yard and get one from there.	0
I read this book in high school and thought it was okay. I decided to read it again as an adult and see what I thought of it (something about going back and reading the classics). Turns out that I liked it more as an adult but found the story to fall short. At the end you can't tell if the main character was tortured, turned or just dreaming. I felt like the first half was really slow, the middle was FANTASTIC and the last bit was just over before I could get my mind around what had happened. I really wish that it could have ended differently. Still worth reading through.The story is about the year 1984 and the hell in which people live in. Countries are always at war, but whom they are fighting keeps changing. Things that Big Brother doesn't like are just erased. Whole histories, whole stories, are whipped as if they never were. People live in hunger and fear of Big Brother.	1
Of Mice and Men was an assigned reading in my class. At first I thought it was good (in the first chapter), but then I read on. The book did not suit me. I would not recommend this book to anyone, because I thought it was a bad story. The author's writing style was good, but the plot was stupid. Some of the characters were believable, but others were very inrealistic. The ending was very sad, and you would have never seen it coming.	0
I tried these Jobst 15-20 mmHg pantyhose in my search for high quality therapeutic support pantyhose for a severe circulation problem in one of my legs. I did find them a little difficult to put on, but once they were on they stayed in place nicely and provided great support.The only problem I had was, like the other review stated...they ran the second time I wore them. For as expensive as these pantyhose are, they should last longer than 2 wearings.They are not too sheer, if that is something you are looking for in support hose. They look more like tights when they are on your legs. I did find the beige shade to be a little more like a pale nude shade.	0
This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose.	0
When I was little I really loved this movie I used to have the roger rabbit doll where you pull the string in the back and the doll talked. I still have the movie on VHS and watch it occasionally every now and then I just don't have the doll anymore but excellent movie very good. 2 thumbs up. If you like Roger Rabbit then get this movie in dvd better quality of the picture I think but if your old school then go for VHS.	1
This bed was cheap and the quality was consistent with the price. The seams deformed about 6 months after use began and bulges formed that eventually made the product unusable. Don't purchase for long term use. The seam design is flawed, which is probably why most of the other manufacturers offer a quilted pattern. The return shipping and 50% refund potential make recovering any money impossible. I got some use out of the bed, but definitely wouldn't buy anything else from this manufacturer.	0
I bought the Furniture refinisher and had 5 of my friends come over to help me refinish my cabinets. I bought everything that was recommended to use, the steel wool pads and the chemical gloves. This product ate through all the gloves we used, it disolved one of my friends acrylic fingernails, it felt like it was ice-burning our skin, made us all light-headed in a ventilated room and it barely did any improvements to my cabinets. I am concerned about us all absorbing this into our skin and any effect that may cause. I am returning all of the cans and I am VERY disappointed in this product.	0

"The GoFit 65cm Professional Stability Ball is not equal in quality to the stability balls at our local gym.The ball seems too soft and pliable. I would investigate other brands, or see what your local gym is usingbefore ordering. ""Professional"" seems to be a bit of a stretch!"	0
I was really excited about this product since it had so many wonderful reviews, especially coming from people with pale skin like mine. The product didn't live up to my expectations at all. I turned orange the first night, but I continued to try it out for at least a week to be able to give an accurate review. I just became more and more orange, it streaked everywhere, and overall looked extremely fake. I'm really disappointed because I thought this would finally be the best tanning product out there for people with light/pale skin, but once again it just didn't work. I think this would work well for others who have a base tan already.	0
Hardy paints a cruel picture of women in lower society. They are either tempted or cause evil mischief with a tragic ending. He had created a virtuous women in the form of Tess and ends her as a criminal. It is impossible for a women of Tess's virtue to turn into a criminal. I would not recommend this book to anyone who would look to escape from Depression.	0
I am so disappointed with the Eebee DVD. I bought it based on a review in Parents magazine, and also from the reviews posted here. I feel Eebee DVD's are geared for first time parents, when their babies are just starting to move around. It gives you some great ideas of things to do with your new explorer. My 16 month old is an avid Baby Einstein watcher (LOVES them!) and was not interested in this DVD AT ALL. Not even little Eebee himself could hold my toddler's attention.	0
This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth	1
I've read some of the reviews and have to disagree with them - this is a really sweet movie. Adam Sandler's character (Henry) is the typical luv 'em and leave 'em kind of guy before he meets Drew Barrymore's character, Lucy. Due to brain damage from a car accident a year earlier, Lucy can't convert short term memory into long term memory - she keeps replaying the same day over and over. Henry is intrigued by this at first, and tries each day to get Lucy to like him. After awhile, though, he truly starts to care for her and wants to help her move on with her life. Other characters - the friends from the bar and Lucy's father - are super in how they protect her by replaying the same day over with her. Her brother is definitely doofy, but easily ignored. This movie is a romance with a happy ending. Prepare to smile alot and maybe even cry a few tears!	1
Terribly misleading picture. The Black writing on yellow plastic is exactly what I was looking for, and it is exactly the way most Swanson tools are made. NOT THIS ONE. This is all yellow without a hint of a shadow for contrast. You can still use it for square cuts and such, but don't count on reading the numbers. Get the metal version that is all grey - they are easier to read even with their lack of contrast.I plan to keep the one I ordered and spray paint it black and then quickly wipe the paint off of the flat surfaces in the hopes of getting something like what is pictured. Shame on Amazon for using this picture.	0
Here you'll find Elton John's music transcribed down to a tee. This is a welcome change to nonsensical 'interpretations' that conspicuously sound exactly the same as the melody line. You want to play 'Bennie and the Jets' from the starting heavy chords to the verse to the jazzy piano solo, here you go. Blue Eyes, Rocket Man, Someone Saved My Life Tonight (excellent song)... it's all here. In some instances (like Honky Cat for example), there's just no point in bothering to learn the music EXACTLY, because Elton John just improvised within chords in the first place. So it's best for you to do the same unless you want to pore through pages of the same music phrased slightly differently. Next time it would be better to include the more 'precise' songs in Elton's catalogue.Anyway, this is a great collection. Some of the songs aren't very well known but get the album they're on and you're away. Hours of fun.	1
I played this record and boy, this song is off the wall. The original is way better than the club mix, but the club mix is good to, actually it's between good and way better. Played this song for 2 hours and danced to it. I may have lost few pounds from it. Give this song a try it's not a waste of money. I swear on it.	1

We bought this to fill a duvet cover for summer. It's light weight, as we needed, and serves its purpose, considering the price and quality. Other similar light weight comforters in the marketplace cost 4+ times this one. No sales tax & no shipping (Amazon Prime) help make this a good deal.	1
this foot pump works fine for low pressure fills. It is a short fill cylinder so it takes a lot of pumps to fill your item, but it is effective. You need to make sure its on a level surface since the 4 feet need to be stable. it is a little wobbly, but if you use it with care it will do the job just fine.	1
rating to any MacDonald book but this one is deserves it. In my opinion it's the weakest of the McGee series. I wouldn't avoid it if I were going through the series but don't look for the usual MacDonald here. It's fairly strong on character as MacDonald always is but a very weak, convoluted plot takes away from any strength of character the writer exhibits. It's like MacDonald got caught up in it and didn't know how to extricate himself! Not a particularly good read.	0
This DVD is a waste of money. I brought this DVD based on the 5 STARS reviews; the reviewers must be Lisa's friends and associates. There are no instructions for variations of levels. The DVD says so many reps for beginners, intermediate, and advance; but, there are no cues as to when and what levels should be doing what. There is no consideration for a learning curve or alternate ways of doing certain routines. There are way too many breaks for such a short workout routine. I purchases this DVD for an intense workout at home when I am unable to go to the gym; will have to invest in another Kettlebell workout. Lisa is making hand over fist on this DVD at the buyers expense.	0
I'm not exactly going out on a limb to say this is going to be the same transfer used almost five years ago by NoShame films. The Strange Vice of Mrs. Wardh is a pretty good giallo, I'd give the film itself 3 stars. If you didn't buy the out of print NoShame disc this may be a good option.It will be interesting to see if this is indeed the same transfer from NoShame and if it will include the great extras from that disc. Also, if it isn't a new transfer and doesn't have the extras, it will be funny that the NoShame disc from five years ago was list priced at $19.95 while this is listed as $24.95!Time will tell but beware of this shady company, who charges more and gives you less.	0
My bookclub picked this book as every once in a while we do a classic and many in my club had fond memories of this book. Unfortunately, I couldn't finish it. I got about half through and was never engaged in it. I found myself skimming much of it and finally decided that I'd move on to something else. I think if you enjoy lots of detailed description, this might be a good book for you. It moved too slowly for me, though.	0
Mathew West is one of the best Christian rock voices out there. Just saw him this summer live with my daughter and it was wonderful. Got this for Christmas and been playing it ever since!	1
I ordered this ball. First it get lost in transit. I took my refund and ordered it again. Then the ball came, it writes 75 cm. both on ball and on package but the ball is actually 65 cm. !!! I have measured it with a tape and it rolls through a 65 cm. width area. I`m gonna order this again but only god knows what`ll i get.Also the real problem is; most people do not measure their balls ( LOL ) and with this product coming with a package stating that it is 75 i believe most people use the wrong-sized balls. The reason for me to write this is; i tried to contact their customer services. They do not answer or return to your complains...	0
Mart√≠nez Sobral's symphonic scenes Acuarelas Chapinas, is a real revelation. Magnificently orchestrated pieces, they have an immediate and direct impact. As much as Falla's Nights in the Gardens of Spain or Ives' Three Places in New England, they describe a place, in this case, a city in Latin America circa 1905. Ricardo Castillo's tone poem Xibalb√° evoques a world of magic and legends of the Mayan world. This is music that important conductors should take into account to enlarge their repertoires, introducing names from the past that merit the best disclosure.	1
If you don't already know and understand the basic object terminology explained in this book, you probably don't need to start with a book on object databases. I would also read the reviews of this author's other books. They are mostly very bad. This author seems to write more book than anyone could write and do a good job - even if they wrote fulltime - much less if they taught college as this author claims to. This book is probably not worth the money or your time.	0
The author's intense focus on the main character's inner thoughts and feelings limits the reader's scope and prevents a broad view of the social environment of the book's setting. It was difficult to sustain an interest in the narrow range of concerns that surface in the exhausting detail flowing from the character's mind.	0
"This novel is absolutely awful. Although it has received over 500 reviews I feel it is my duty to help bring the average star level to where it belongs, at zero. Where to begin... perhaps with the run on sentences, the failure to create significant rising action, the flat two dimensional characters... This novel is full of things which not only bore the reader, but frustrate them as well.The fatal flaw in this piece of literature is its inability to stay relevant. Post-modern society does not really care about, ""Baby daddies,"" and the revelation which is made at the end, and beginning, of this novel is reproduced daily on morning television a la Maury. Unfortunately, Nathaniel Hawthorn you are the father of this literary disaster."	0
I read a lot of historical fiction. This is perhaps the third novel in the last 10 years that I could not finish because it was so slow. I forced myself to 250 or 270 pages but the story drags on.Its simply boring.	0

"I've always loved Brian McKnight's music. From ""Back at One"" to ""Still the One"" to ""One Last Cry"" and ""Anytime""... loved em all. If you're hoping for anything remotely like those, you'll wish you hadn't spent the money. It's such a shame that I have to not recommend this album, but it just doesn't shine. I sense that he feels like he needs to get back to ""his roots"" by going more soulful, more slow hip-hoppy. And while he succeeds on those points, it's just not gonna produce a top 10 single on regular top 40 radio. It sorta reminds me of later efforts from Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston where they stopped delivering the kinds of music their fans wanted and instead did their own thing. What a shame, and what a letdown."	0

"This is a decorative item that, although it's advertized as ""crystal,"" looks a great deal more like pressed glass. It does, however, come with ""lead content warnings"" so one must assume that it is, indeed, lead crystal. But don't expect sparkle -- the item is neither cut nor polished.It's small and pretty, and comes in a cheap plastic presentation case lined with flocked paper and Disney advertising. Still, what else are you going to give to a woman cast in the role?"	0

I was expecting to read a book about the Amish. What I read instead was a very self centered book about a woman searching, rather blindly, I felt, for herself.She had very little in the way of insight into Amish life, even after spending a period of time with them. And her inability to get outside of her own head/her own life was not terribly interesting to read.For someone who always longed to be a 'star,' I am sure publishing a book was quite a thrill for her. Shame she used the Amish as a platform for her own ego.	0
The Simple Tech card worked from day 1, and still works 4 months later. Probably have taken close to 1000 shots on this card cumulatively.The same cannot be said for two other Viking Cards, one 512 MB, one 256 MB. Both worked in the beginning, then days later generated corrupt image files. (Go to Viking compact flash 512MB for my detailed review)By the way, I own a G3, and cannot tell meaningful difference in speed among Simple Tech, Viking, and the Lexar 12X I just received.	1
The book Of mice and Men was a good book. It keeps you wanting to know more the whole way through. The characters are described very well, but the two main characters are opposite. One, named Lennie, is big tall and stupid, he acts like a five-year-old as they put it in the book. The other one, George, is short and kind of smart compared to Lennie. Unlike most of the other ranch hands the two are traveling together from ranch to ranch, and even more than others are because Lennie is always getting into trouble. Lennie loves soft things, which gets him into a lot of trouble. At this last ranch they think they will finally fulfill their dream and earn enough money to buy a piece of land, Lennie gets into the biggest mess of all.	1
"I was one of those people who dismissed Garbage when they first came out because I was a big fan of Curve. I know, I was a stupid boy. ""Version 2.0"" is when I realized this is an amazing band. I'd be shocked if any fan of techno, pop, alternative, or girl-fronted-rock-bands didn't love this disc. In itself it's almost the best of Garbage. They all sound like singles. Other than the obvious 3-4 hits, I was most impressed by ""Temptation Waits"", ""Medication"", ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing"", and ""You Look So Fine"". If you've ever thought about getting some Garbage, especially this album, do it. Don't be a stupid boy/girl."	1
"This was the first Anne Perry book I have read, but it will be the last. I found the basic premise of the main character's amnesia to be a gimmick. It irritated me that he would never ""come clean"" about his lack of memory, especially when we find out that the people he worked with could see through it. I have enjoyed other murder-mysteries where the villain was a lot less obvious to the reader. It seems from her sales figures that I am in the minority - what am I missing?"	0
(...) this is by far the best book on Jakarta-Tomcat. I learned more in the few hours spent reading this book, then I did in the days(weeks?) spent reading existing documentation and newsgroups. The book covers all of the newest features, and provides practical examples. All in all, a very useful resource.	1

Like it says, it's heavy duty. It feels thick and hefty when you place it onto the box. I use it to ship stuff, and it keeps the label water-tight, as well as affixes all sorts of things to plastic or cardboard shipping containers.	1
"This version of the Canterbury Tales in modern English is brilliant. Nonetheless I was deeply disappointed in finding that the Parson's Tale was omitted completely, the reason being that ""it does not interest the general public"". I disagree with such a sweeping statement."	0
Everything the other reviews say about this product is largely true: the cord is thicker and more durable than the Apple adapter, the brick doesn't get as unnervingly hot, you can deal with the fact that it's not powerful enough to be used as a power source... but one day it just mysteriously stops working. I bought this to replace my broken Apple adapter and was generally very pleased with it, but about a month later I went to plug it in one day and it just wouldn't work. My laptop showed no connectivity, the little charge light on the brick didn't go on, and after tinkering with the thing at length I couldn't get anything to change. If you want a cheap, temporary replacement charger, I guess this would be fine. But for anything long-term it might just be worth shelling out $80 for something that at least lasts a year or two.	0

"It had to be God's Providence. Bill Gaither and the members of the Vocal Band at that time invited a few friends and mentors to join them in the Gaither's studio to record ""Where Could I Go."" But ""it just so happened"" that the cameras kept rolling when the song was finished. What we see after that are the testimonies and prayers that these Christian friends share and the spontaneous songs and harmonies that flowed from their stories. This video deserves much more than the tag ""collector's item."" Rather, it captures the spirit of Southern Gospel music. When I saw this for the first time almost 20 years ago I smiled and cried as I sang along. I grew up with these voices in my head, their songs part of my spiritual heritage. It was like...coming home."	1
I thought this movie would be something more, but the teaser trailer was far better than the movie! I understood that it wasn't a jump out horror movie, but more of a psychological thriller thing, and still, no good. Maybe the only thing good in it was Catherine Zeta-Jones that neat merry-go-round / mirror room, and the special effects.. I also found the other characters in the movie quiet boring, and the plot confused me until the third time I watched it. But if you like slow-paced movies that eventually end, then this is for you.	0
This movie was not meant to be taken seriously....I think what they tried to do here is re-live the 80's action flick experience. If you watch this movie you are falsly lead to believe that you can be blown up and still survive, take a fire extinguisher to the face and get right back up, and can be shot at 100's of times and not take a hit. The dialouge is silly, however, the acting is pretty good. Sit back and enjoy/laugh.	0
All I can say is Do Not buy this. Not even worth the $8. Never worked. Not worth the hassle of returning. I looked at replacing the cells inside of it but I can buy a better portable battery unit for about the same $$ as fixing this thing so I tossed it.	0
The look of the machine looks beautiful & very well build. However, doesn't work (DOA). I'm willing to exchange for another machine if it's still in stock. Unfortunately, this is the last one. I'm thankful that Amazon is willing to pay for return shipping.	0
I liked this book a lot. I liked the drawings and the words. I learned alot about nature. I'm glad my mom bought this book for me. Someday I want to work in the outdoors.	1
I was looking for a capless flash drive so I wouldn't need to keep track of the cap, and the retractable design of this works well. The hardware functions without problems and is even attractive. The case is real metal -- I know because my magnetic bracelet tried to stick to it! (With no harm to either.)Only warning is that the pre-loaded U3 software tries to load itself every time the drive is inserted into a computer -- REALLY annoying when you are trying to use the drive the transfer files to a colleague and it tries to load onto their machine! Even when de-activated, the U3 thing claims a drive name for itself. I thought it would be fun to try the U3 functions but I'm ready to erase the whole thing to get it to stop trying to take over.	1

"In the book Of Mice and Men by Jonh Steinbeck is about two men that looking for jobs from ranch to ranch.This story takes place in Soledad California,during the Great depresion.The story has two characters: the most important characters are George & Lennie. George is ""small, quick, dark of face and strong hands"" & the other guy is Lennie ""A huge man he has a mind of a child & he likes to touch soft things."" Everything that he knows is because George has thought him. They have dreams, that want to accomplish. Do you think yhat George wants to live & accomplish the dreams with Lennie?I rate this book 4 stars & I really recommend this book to teens because there's only one in a million that knows what friendship is really about. I learned from this book is how to be a better friend."	1
"IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE 1 STAR REVIEW, I AM THE ONE THAT LEFT A COMMENT IN FAVOR, BUT WONDERING WHY THEY LEFT ONLY ONE STAR. IT HAD TO BE A MISTAKE BECAUSE SHE GAVE IT A ""HAUNTING"" REVIEW, IF NOT TOO SHORT. THE TUNE: 'ESTATE' IS WITH OUT A DOUBT A FIVE STAR TUNE. IN FACT, ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL JAZZ VOCAL NUMBERS I CAN REMEMBER HEARING. HOWEVER, THE REST OF THE CD, I FEEL FALLS FAR SHORT OF ESTATE. ALL OF THE MUSIC IS SOFT AND NICE, BUT JUST DIDN'T GRAB ME PERSONALLY. REGARDLESS, YOU MAY WANT TO GIVE IT A TRY. IF NOTHING ELSE, IT WOULD BE NICE QUIET BACKGROUND FOR DINNER OR SLOW AND ALONE DANCING WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE."	1
If you like early Mark Harmon, then it is worth the time. Otherwise, it is a made for TV style situation comedy. There are some embarrassing moments and a heart-warming ending.	0
"I really enjoyed the first 100 pages of King Rat and expected good things from the remaining chapters. But the novel goes downhill as the reader is forced to learn more about Peter Marlowe, a character I suspect we're supposed to admire for his complexity. The dialogue between prisoners is forced and the sub-plots are only of marginal interest. I found myself skimming the final third of the novel, as concentrating on it was much too painful.With a 4 and 1/2 star rating, a prospective reader would think they were buying ""The Brothers Karamazov"". Same goes for all of the books on Amazon that suffer from 'grade inflation'. With every novel commanding 4 or more stars, what's left to differentiate the great novels?"	0
"This POS started giving ""English font only"" and ""download new firmware from ""www.creative.com"" within 3 hours of using it after it was fully charger. Creative has NO firmware upgrade for this model since it is so new, and support cannot help. Search for ""rhomba firmware"" at google and visit Creative's European customer support forum page - there are oodles and oodles of Europeans with this same fatal error that they cannot recover from at all. People are throwing around unreleased firmware in that forum for this thing since Creative still has not released it. *sigh* another bug-ridden thing from Creative. Going back for the iPod 10GB - $100 upgrade, but I am sure I will have NO problems making that thing work since it is an Apple."	0

"I read a article about Spycams in MLK Jr holiday. The neighborhood watch was using cameras to protect the neighbors somewhere in CA. Somewhere in the article says "" tracing George Orwell's 1984, 'BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING YOU'. "" or something like that. Wow. I just can't believe a 1949 novel turns real in 1999, that's 50 years! If you don't know what I'm talking about.... that's because I'm just too exicted. What if a jail turns to a Room 101?"	1
"This is a great story about the classic battle of good versus evil. Well written, beautiful views and adventure to keep kids interested. My kids also like the talking Narnian animals. If you like the Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe, you will like this also. The next one is the Voyage of the Dawn Treader, another well loved ""Chronicle'' in the series:)"	1
A friend suggested this herb to me to help with my awful PMS. After taking Vitex for only three days during PMS, I began to feel horrible: very irritable, nauseous and foggy. After doing some research, I found that a percentage of women react very negatively to this herb -- some people remarked that they initially felt better, but then progressively felt worse and thought they were going crazy; some said they immediately felt terrible. I guess it's a gamble that many of us are willing to take to feel better though. Wish it had worked!	0
I'm glad I rented this one first, because image quality was horrible. I popped the disc in my PC to take a look, and discovered the movie was only 2.8GB. What was Paramount thinking? A DVD can hold 8+ GB. The more space that's used, the higher the bitrate. A low bitrate results in poor image quality. So, what we get is a DVD that's nearly empty, and a highly compressed mess of a movie. Thanks for nothing, Hollywood.	0
"John Feinstein may very well be the best golf writer around, but that doesn't mean that all of his books are instant classics like A Good Walk Spoiled. ""Open"" details the tournament at Bethpage in painstaking detail, from the history of the course, to the political machinations to get the tournament at the course, to the renovation of the course, to the volunteers, to the tournament itself. Although the devil is in the details, I would have appreciated more of the tournament and less of the development. Still a great read, but I wanted more golf and less golf course."	1
Edward Chiera presented wonderful information on his research of ancient civilizations. Very easy to read for Jr. High students. However, his personal comments on religion(s) was just that, his personal comments, nothing factual. Recommeded reading for students with religious chapters omitted.	0
I had to read this book for a project in reading class. This book was very hard to understand, especially in the scenes where her father beats her. The plot was adequate, but ther seemed to be little chapters that contributed to the plot of this book. The climax was not all that exciting for me, especially since my brother and sister have talked about it and read it. The descriptions of characters were little, partly because of the book's first person narroration. There are also some discrepancies in this book that left me asking too many questions at the end of the story. I enjoy books that leave me asking little or no questions at the end. It was also historical fiction, which is a popular genre to teach. I don't care for it	0
This was by far the worst science fiction novel I have ever watched. While the story of two lovers may seem romantic to some people, the use of spaceships and alien robots was very unneccesairy. The worst part of this play had to be the end where both charaters joined up with Marty McFly to save the universe. Thumbs down to you sir! The remix WAS better.	0
My brother and I have had to split our time on the internet for a while. (He has a desktop which uses an ethernet cable to connect to the internet, while I have a laptop which requires the ethernet cable to be plugged into an airport) So for Christmas, I decided to give him a gift that would please me as well, this wireless adapter. The install was pretty simple, and then we downloaded the drivers. The PC recognized it fine, and recognized my ireless signal, but for some reason, the computer didn't recognize the wireless internet it was providing. We were unable to figure out why. About a week went by of fiddling with different things, like disabling the ethernet card, on the hypothesis that it was still somehow trying to draw internet from that, but even that didn't work. Finally, my brother found some way to install new drivers for the PCI card. After he did this, it worked fine. I hope this review helps anyone that might be having similar troubles.	1
This book was a WASTE OF MY SUMMER VACATION! I had to read it for school and I'm going into 10th grade which doesn't make any sense to me. The plot seemed to be directed at 4th graders but no 4th grader would understand the language. I might have given T.H. White a little more credit had this been entirely his creation, but he didn't make up the story; it's an Arthurian Legend (obviously). He even stole some lines from Shakespeare! All he did was write it, and the writing was unbearable. Unless you enjoy mind-numbing boredom, don't waste your time on the Sword in the Stone.	0
I think this is one of those books where you read it and take what resonates with you from it. I did and lost 13 pounds just by doing the healthy eating recommendations. I also followed his recommendatin of staying away from the middle isles at the supermarket because they are the ones with the food that has all the preservatives/toxins in the packaging. It worked for me. I feel a hell of a lot healthier and in tune to my body and what it needs. There is other good stuff in the book too. I would definitely tell someone to buy it. -IB	1
"Marlon Brando is a marvelous actor, but PLEASE someone ELSE write his dialogue! On how many different occasions in one film do we need to hear about pigs? I have never understood why this movie is lauded so much, so I decided to give it another chance. The dialogue is simply absurd. Who talks like this? The relationship between Brando and the young French girl is very S&M;, but in my opinion, these themes were explored better and more attractively in ""9 1/2 Weeks"". If you're looking for nudity and graphic sex, you won't find that here either. The sex scenes are few and far between, and when they do occur your reaction will most likely be ""OH! MY EYES!!""A film without a writer is a recipe for disaster, and it really shows here. Skip this. You're not missing a thing."	0
I absolutely love these diapers. I used a big box of Huggies previously and we were cleaning up poopie messes almost daily. My baby has only had about 5 accidents in the past month with these. They do keep him very dry and not soaked if there is a lot of pee. My baby is very chunky and short, so I have to disagree with a previous review that chunky babies do better with Huggies. These are hands down the best diapers I've used so far.	1
When this dvd was released, somebody struck out on the idea what a dvd concept was about. The commentary's are helpful and informative. But help me understand why this academy award winning movie is not shown in widescreen? Or not having the input of nicholas cage and his viewpoint of the making of the film? Did I mention widescreen?This film must adamantly be rereleased as a special addition in widescreen with full attention to detail then it will deserve five stars. Until then stick to video and save your money.	0
"This book does not present much information about Chopin the man, and stumbles around endlessly about Chopin's music. The prose is laughably dated. Who can not help laughing at sentences like ""Chopin distrusted Jews, but that's the way Poles are."" The French, English, Germans, and Hungarians: Huneker comes up with some interesting stereotypes for them too. Many of the facts are incorrect, as the editor supplies the corrected facts in the footnotes on nearly every page of the text. And the music discussions have the spirit of ""What a powerful melody! However, I believe the third note of the 14th measure of Etude 12 op. 10 should be an F sharp, though it's written differently in some scores."" What a snore. I suggest looking elsewhere for real information about Chopin and his music. This book offers no insights though some occasional unintended laughs."	0
The Black Crowes first three albums were great, but I think they reached their peak with Amorica. They have been on a down slide since then, and this cd just continues that trend. Sorry guys, but this is my last Black Crowes purchase...they just seem to have exhausted all their good ideas for songs.	0
"Economics in One Lesson is another great ""must read"" book. Like Bastiat's ""The Law,"" it is short and sweet. At the same time, it clearly explains the basic fundamentals of economics.Considering the stupid and abusive actions that are rampant in Congress, state legislatures, county commissions and city councils, the overwhelming majority of these so-called 'leaders' are utterly ignorant.Don't you be one of them.Buy and read Economics in One Lesson.Then call up your politicians and give them an earful."	1

TOXIC AVENGER 4 IS AN AMAZING MOVIE. hillarious and filled with violence the DVD is packed with extras including 3 commentaries deleted scenes and a full lengtht documentary on the making of toxie 4 . The best Toxic avenger movie gets one of the best dvd of the past year.	1
Well, this had been on my list for some time. Maybe I expected too much? I think it was probably just a bit above my taste, perhaps. I get that it is satire... I get what is being satirized... Maybe I was not in the right frame of mind and one day I will reread it.It is short and that is easily done.	0
A friend of mine called this book ponderous; she read it in 8th grade. Go back to this one; I keep returning to it myself. Maybe it's in response to my parents' divorce. And how Hawthorne handles adultery -- not the danger and desire, but the punishment and crime. Hester's story begins outside the jail house. An American sex crime. Read it as such. Trust Dover for a good, cheap reprint.	1
I bought this one because its excellent review of another customer. Picture format is only in 4:3 which is ashame. Though the quality of the picture is good. Good encoding, beautifull skin tones. Pitty the lightning director is not that creative and used that awfull backlights with gobo's. The sound is in AC-3 5.1 dolby, but never impressing, and with low dynamics. It's the regular TV-mix we hear, it's not remixed for dolby 5.1 with it's extra dynamics and LFE output.I feel the band is average. The directors cut is not more than an average TV-special. All the way, wouldn't recommend it.	0
I totally missed the point of the novel. Maybe I need a professor to explain the satire but I did not get it. I kept waiting for the story to tell me something about myself or about society - it never did. After reading some of your reviews, I am led to believe that I totally missed the boat. Did I really?	0
Really cute sexy shoe but they do run small and they are very high as well but it said they were stilettos. I love them and I also look the red color.	1
Wonderfully written and illustrated book. I work directly with Georgia Vidalia Onion Producers, and they are all just as charming as the characters in the book. The Vidalia onion is just as sweet and mysteriously inviting as it is portrayed in this poetic book. The book is completely accurate...If this onion is grown anywhere except a few select counties in South Georgia, it is no different than any other onion which makes it a modern day miracle and mystery. The illustrations depict the pristine beauty of rural America. The quality of writing of this book is appealing to adults as well as children. I highly recommend this book!!!!!	1
I read the series for the first time when I was in Matric. As can be believed, I was unable to put down this absolutely riveting book. I have subsequently reread the series twice, and also convinced my family and friends to read it. It is an emotionally evocative tale of a young woman full of strength, courage and an abounding love. I strongly suggest this series, and wait with impatience for the next book.	1
Stargate: Continuum is a good movie that brings together all of the SG-1 characters again... This is a funny & poignant movie, full of some surprises, that creates a dramatic to way to more or less tie up some loose ends when the series ended. I enjoyed it.	1
We purchased this microwave in October for $300 minus the $50 rebate. Panasonic denied our first rebate submission, claiming we'd bought the wrong item. A phone call cleared up the misunderstanding and apparently our rebate is on its way. However, I've since been told that rebate problems and denials are a common occurrence with Panasonic.The microwave has a nice appearance and functions well. However, there is a significant design flaw. You cannot use the hood light as a nightlight or even keep it on for very long without heating up the inside of the microwave to the point where the internal fan comes on and the microwave will not turn on to cook. After the oven cools down, it seems to function normally. The first time this happened, the inside of the oven was so hot I thought it was a short circuit. For that reason, I do not recommend buying this appliance. I wonder if this is why the price has dropped dramatically...	0
While this video is informative and a good source of information for older children, I do NOT recommend it for kids under 3 or 4. My daughter is 2 and loves Elmo's World (we have several other videos) so I figured this would be okay. WRONG! She is now having nightmares and will not be left alone in the dark because she is afraid of fire. She even shakes with fear the way Elmo does at one point during the film. I think the subject matter is too advanced for her and better suited for older children.	0
I am not a professional educator or homeschooler, but as a Dad I need to be sure my kids are learning the things they need to learn. This is a very helpful resource to me because it gives an overview of what kids should be learning at each stage along the way. (Fortunately, my kids' school seems to be doing pretty well in most areas.) This resource helps me plan what areas to supplement with home reading and projects.	1
this is a very funny movie especially if you love the mario brothers games. many references to the games, obviously, and just a fun movie to watch.	1
It's time we consumers let manufacturers know that we're not going to be ripped-off by substandard DVD releases. Once again, a great film has been compromised by releasing it in it's broadcast master aspect ratio. One would like to think that the public is given more credit for having the intellect to understand the difference between a re-packaged broadcast master and a newly transfered master in the original theatrical aspect ratio.So, here's another DVD that will never be purchased for my collection. I urge you to do the same. One day, they'll get our message and stop trying to rip us off.	0
People always talk about books that they can't put down and 1984 is defenitly one of those books. You really feel scared for Winston throughout the entire story. It made me cringe all the times where he was sneaking around. The only thing that made it unrealistic to me was how sex and love were eliminated totally from the party. It goes against human nature. Was everybody tortured like Winston in the party to make them this way? Anyway it was a great book that makes you think	1
I like this BluRay release of the Anthony Hopkins/Ann Margret film. The BluRay transfer was done very nicely and the extras were pretty good but could have been better.I really enjoyed the Dennis Alwood interview, Fats and Friends. I do wish there were new interviews with Anthony Hopkins and Ann Margret though. There is an old, archival Anthony Hopkins interview which leaves much to be desired. Though it's better than nothing.	1
The video is very good, it is cartoon characters which really kept my 5 year old engaged. I think the information is a little bit complex, but in my case that is a good thing because I dont want him to master the DVD the first time he watches it. I think it is great for what it is, I only wish they had a larger series covering more about the subject. I will have to say the materials on the DVD are very catchy, and my son loves watching it. There is also some song choices at the end. 30 minutes is a bit short, but it seems longer wit the menu of all the songs at the end. There really is nothing else out there like this from what I can see.	1
Not sure why I bought this. There are 2 exercises that I enjoy doing. But it is fun, even though it is huge and takes up lots of room! Hard to ignore.	1
Rev. Teel starts out by telling how he was first a believer, then an agnostic, then an atheist, and finally a true believer, but neglects to say what convinced him in each of those instances. If belief, not reason (as it appears), were behind these conversions, then the premise for this book is reduced in importance and effectiveness. For me, one belief is as good as another. I'd like to hear from a writer convinced by reason and recognized facts, not belief(s).	0
"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."	0

We started off with the Pampers Swaddlers, and I bought these ones by mistake. Since I had them, and the reviews were quite good, I decided to keep them. They claim to have an 'ultra absorb core for outstanding leakage protection', but my baby is 10 lbs (size 1 is for 8-14lbs), and after about 5 hours, she had actually leaked through and out onto her outfit! Not just a bit, but palpably and visibly wet! I would pay the extra money and buy the Swaddlers, which is what I have done.	0
"Okay, Clay Aiken may be a dork in person, but the fact of the matter is he won runner up in American Idol and can sing, and that's about it.When I saw him on American Idol, I was disgusted! Clay sings cheesy awful ballads that make you want to hit the ""mute"" button on your remote. What's even more disgusting is his God-awful wardrobe! The fact that so many teenage girls out there are so in love with Clay makes me want to vomit!!! This music is for nerds only! GET REAL!!!!"	0
Quality is a 3, but lets be honest with ourselves, it is a dollar!! For this price, this does it's job extremely well. I use it all day, but when I'm out , I take the case off, its not the most attractive case I've seen.Its a good product for an outstanding price.	1
It's been a number of years since I read this short work for my Pre-1900s British Novels class as an undergraduate, and while my memory is a little fuzzy on the details, my general impression of dislike and boredom is crystal clear. While I'm sure there is complexity in the words, it's hard to overlook the basic fact that almost nothing happens in this first of the sentimental novels.However, I can readily admit that it's obviously at least somewhat preference given all the glowing reviews I have found. I like my books character driven. The kind of characters that I walk away feeling like I know them personally and am sad to part ways. While Yorick is the driving force, he lacked that depth.We followed it up with Evelina by Burney, which was far more enjoyable.	0

"Bill Nichols is full of words and empty of thought. You need a machete to slash through the tangled sentences in this book, and what you'll find beneath are simplistic, flawed ideas that aren't developed but buried under more verbiage. Nichols stitches suffixes and prefixes to ordinary nouns, creating monsters like ""situatedness,"" ""hyperrationality,"" ""reconceptualization,"" ""polyvocality,"" ""relationality,"" ""talismanic""(!), and the pseudo-literate's favorite word of all: ""juxtaposition."" Each of those words costs as much time to understand as a whole chapter of Erik Barnouw's book (which is succinct, informative and even humorous). Mr. Nichols should be sealed in a cave and his books slung into outer space, for they pollute the body of film knowledge. Don't buy ""Representing Reality"" unless you want to know how confused Mr. Nichols's reality is."	0
AudioSource AMP-100 Stereo Power AmplifierThis amp powers a pair of medium two-way speakers for my home theater. Very good sound for the money. As others have noted, the line inputs are not terribly sensitive, and my Blue-ray player's line outs put out barely enough; I crank the amp's volume control almost all the way up with most movies. No one has complained of insufficient volume. (Someone wrote that there is a line-in sensitivity adjustment or a max gain adjustment or the like, but I cannot find it.) A preamp with a 3- or 4-volt line out would solve this problem and add needed spectrum control, but at greatly increased cost. You can power either of two pairs of speaker connections but not both; the spec sheet is a little vague on this point. I wouldn't upgrade from this amp before spending at least $2000 on speakers.	1
Dont buy this if you want good sound and power! worthless to me for my use! Didn't work worth a DAMN!	0
very bad paper quality. some of them torn on side. papers had different size!!! so some were popping out of book!!! not happy with my purchase.	0
There are many good Muslims. Unfortunately, the author, Mr. Mamdani is not one of them. He is one of those verbal terrorists who continues to blame America and Israel for his own disastrous failures and the inability of the Arab and Muslim world to get past the 15th century. The chapters on America and Israel's Genocidal activities are filled with such ridiculous points that any 9 year old could refute them.If you would like to read a pathetic comedy, this is the right book. However, it is more of a waste of good trees. Mahmood is just another leftist professor who continues to criticize and abuse the hand that feeds him, America. He is no different than the troubled child who abuses his wonderful parents, and his silly book proves it.Irwin N. Graulich	0
I've tried several different wired and wireless adapters for the TiVo. This one is the easiest to set up. You just plug it in and it's ready. The connection is well built, not flimsy like several other adapters I've tried.	1
Used while camping for a week and was delighted by the level of comfort and the ease of inflating with the built in pump! Air loss for me was in line with the many other airbeds I have owned, and with the built in pump, made it easy to top it off every other day or so. Highly recommend this great affordable air mattress!	1
I bought this clamp and it turns out I need digital multimeter to operate it. I do not understand DMMs means before . After i received it and read the intruction then I understood. I wished that the ad could be more clearer. I have not returned it yet because it cost money to send it back.Any suggestion ? Mean a while I already bought another fluke amp meter that does not need another digital meter to operate it.	0
I'm still considered a new mom I only have one toddler she is 2 years old. I only order her diapers online now. I have gone to the stores in my town and her size is always always always sold out but with amazon her size is always here and here.

The cases that haunt us is a mesmerizing read. I did not put it down until I finished it. I have read all of Douglas's & Olshaker's books,and as usual the information presented in the book is well researched. The book is well-written and Douglas's behavioral analysis on each of the subjects is brilliant. What I found most compelling was the way in which Douglas and Olshaker paint a vivid picture of life during the times of the Ripper, Borden and Lindbergh cases. In this essence, the book was quite visual. This book is a must read for any Douglas fan or anyone wishing to experience his expertise for the first time.	1
Our daughter is 6 months old and 19 lbs. She has been wearing these size 3 Pampers, and we wake up to exploded diapers many mornings, with little gel beads all over DD. I'm switching to Huggies overnight, based on a co-worker's recommendation.	0
I bought this product based off reviews saying it tastes great and I was extremely disappointed. As soon as I started steeping it this smell filled my kitchen (my daughter even asked what the horrible smell was). Sadly, it was this tea. I tried it and it tastes like sweaty socks also. It is so gross. I have tried adding honey, drinking it cold, drinking it hot, etc and they all taste horrible. As far as a diet aid, I don't think so. I guess if you had a lot of excrement in you, possibly. I even doubled the suggested amount and I still did not anything happen (and no, I was not on the toilet a lot either). All in all, this product was a big thumbs down to me.	0
After the baby mulilations I couldn't read any more. I am still haunted by the images from that, as the mother of three young sons it was too disturbing for me. Definitely will not purchase any more books from this author. I couldn't donate this one to our libary's book sale fast enough!	0
"I bought this cd the first day it came out and haven't removed it from my cd player yet! Over a year after the release! The 12 excellent songs on this cd never get old, no matter how many times you listen to them. Shirley Manson is one of the best, if not THE BEST, artists out there today. As far as it being one of the best albums ever i agree! Its right up there with my other favorites: Hole ""Live Through This"", Rage Against the Machine ""Evil Empire"", Live ""Throwing Copper"", Smashing Pumpkins ""Siamese Dream"", Beastie Boys ""Paul's Boutique"", Pearl Jam ""Ten"", and, of course, Garbage's Selftitled Debut album!!!"	1
Needed amp to power CD player for workshop. This unit works great. No bells or whistles, just straight-up power for a medium sized sound system. Came packed well with clear simple instructions. Delivery went as promised. Would recommend this product.	1
"I have one of those ""spare tire"" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to ""make"" me look trimmer..."	1
If you are a designer who wants to know how to customize Plone's look beyond changing colors and fonts, you'll be disappointed in this book. Sure, the introduction is still good, but chapter 6 (for example), which instructs you to work with the Plone Base Properties file is giving you an outdated method, not well suited to upgrades and maintenance. I believe that stylesheets are the way to go, now...but I'm still trying to figure it out, no thanks to this book. The instructions for adding slots in Chapter 5 were just impossible to follow and did not even vaguely work. Yes, the text is in English, but the descriptions bear little resemblence to the Plone 2.1+ experience.This book will, however, give a somewhat glossy overview of the entire application. I would get a recent version of Andy McKay's book, and look elsewhere for customization help.	0
Bradbury's view on the future is startling. He has made many correct predictions on how the future would develop. He helps to remind us that books and knowledge are what we crave and need to be happy.	1
It thought this movie was going to be cool,but the beggining was so boring i fell assleep! But the end was cool.	0
I originally bought these diapers for my daughter to wear at night. They leaked so badly that I couldn't use them. My daughter would be soaked from her chest clear down to her socks. Of course she would wake up early. I had to wash all of her bedding and her jammies every night. You can imagine what the scene looked like when she pooped! To get rid of this box of diapers, I used them during day use, but, again, the swaddlers worked better and seemed more comfortable for my daughter. The Baby Dry seemed very thin and very uncomfortable....almost papery. Not good.	0
I am using this pillow now and about to enter my second trimester. I find the pillow to be comfortable and useful in training myself to sleep on my side. I actually find the pillow most comfortable upside down (with the connected piece at my feet). This allows me to use the side bolsters, elevate my feet, AND use my own pillow.	1
"I recently added ""No Reason to Cry"" to my Clapton discography collection. It was the last Clapton commercial release I acquired. I can only ask myself how I let this gem slip through the cracks. I agree with most reviewers that ""461"" and ""Slowhand"" are better recordings. However, the disappointment listeners feel with this album is a testament to Clapton's brilliance. By any other artist, this recording would be getting far greater accolades. However, Clapton fans are used to over-the-top, superb recordings on a regular basis, rendering us spoiled. I submit that an ""average"" Clapton album is superior to many musician's best work. My favorite song on the album, written by EC, is ""Hello Old Friend."" Simple and beautiful."	1
THIS GUY IS SSOOOOOOOO WACK IT HURTS.....HE RECYCLES SO MANY LINES AND EVERY ALBUM OF HIS THAT YOU BUY HAS THREE TO FOUR DUPLICATE TRACKS FROM THE ALBUM BEFORE JUST WITH A DIFFERENT BEAT. ITS RIDICULOUS....WHAT ARE THEY PAYING HIM FOR. HE DOESN'T EVER COME WITH ANY NEW MATERIAL....HIS KKKILER FETUS ALBUM HAD NUMEROUS RECYCLED SONGS FROM THE CLOSED CASKET ALBUM AS DID THE GOTHAM CITY CD.....JUST LIKE THE HELLTER SKELLLTER ALBUM , AND ALL OF HIS SUBSIQUENT ALBUMS FOLLOWED SUIT....HOW ARE THESE PEOPLE GIVING HIM 5 STAR REVIEWS, I HAVE LOST ALL HOPE IN HIP HOP. WHATEVER HAPPENED TO ORIGINALITY.	0
I totally agree with andrew...and by the way, people who dont know any of us and dont really know whats going on...please dont waste your time with this movie...you're better off watching old reruns of whos the boss...even though im deprived of cable and wouldnt know...most of you probably know who this is	0
"""Love's Second Sight"" is a great, imaginative story based on stanzas contained in medieval Icelandic texts ""The Vinland Saga, the ""Greenlander's Aga"" and ""Saga of Erik the Red.""Thorgunna must rule an island as a woman in an era where men are in charge. At the same time, she is agonized by Loki, the God of Lies -- trapped between the old gods and the Christ.It's easy to see why this book has garnered so many great reviews. There is top-notch writing throughout, a compelling storyline and an ending that will have your heart pounding. I will look forward to more from Darragha Foster. Recommended."	1
Love the book, very appropriate for the time we live in. It arrived in the condition described.	1
What an adorable little boy and enchanting story. You really get a reality check about bringing up children in the city.	1
Boring, boring, boring. After 120 pages, I gave up. What is the point? I guess I don't get it. What was this guy smoking? How many characters need the same name? How many absurd tortures do we need to read about? The fantasy appears to be thrown in just for the sake of making incidences wild and imaginary and do not seem to be relative to the story or themes. Maybe something was lost in the translation, but if this is the next best thing to Genesis, we're all in trouble. Read The Red Tent --- it comes a lot closer to that billing.Sorry, but I have other books to read, and many yawns before I sleep.	0
I am impressed with the language and content of the Missionary Pal: Reference Guide> I did not expect to see references from several religions, but was glad they were mentioned. This way I gained a better understanding thru comparison.	1
"Fake airbushed pictures, ie Andy Roddick. That guys arms turned out bigger than his waist. This magazine used to be okay. I think they spend more time with tanning, lights, make-up and Photoshop that they do with real athletes. If they cut out the ""4-page advertisements"" every 6 pages along with all the adds at back of the magazine it would consist of the cover and a 1/2 page article. They should pay people to accept it in the mail, hard to charge for a brochure. I just wish it was more ""real"" and less about selling us on smelling like roses and wearing $350 desinger shoes, cater to the average Joe who just wants to get good info and work-out ideas. I could watch QVC and MTV to cover any lack of B.S. I may be experiencing. Your best bet is to just surf the net, buy books, save your money."	0
Could not find this movie at the stores where I live, but sure found it on Amazon. This movie was a gift to my daughter for Christmas and I got it way ahead of time and she loved it.	1
I liked Flint, I trusted him to deliver his usual good reading but now, I have been scammed to the bones by his three last spin-off's, the Galileo Affair, the Grantville Gazette, and the Ram Rebellion. Do not buy any of those awful books, you would be,like me, finding yourself in the category ' A mark is born every minute'. Those three rate a very high Minus...	0
I am not happy with Gerber at all. I researched their products and they do not have to list ingredients if below a certain percentage. (LIKE IF GREEN BEANS WERE MADE ON A CONVEYER OF WHERE RICE WAS MADE AND THE RICE WAS UNDER A CERTAIN AMOUNT TRACED THEY DO NOT LIST IT ON THE INGREDIENTS). The beans I did not know have fish oil in it. It is now listed on the product ingredients.	0
Just got back from a 9 mile hike in the Smoky Mountains. These boots did great. Very comfortable and held up well on the terrain. Highly recommended.	1
Eilenberg's book opens the complex and fascinating topic of intellectual property, in addition to providing brilliant readings of the major poems of these two seminal Romantic poets.	1
"There are a few mildly catchy songs, but tracks like ""Half A Week Before Winter,"" which mentions vampires, ""She Floats,"" which seemingly tells the tale of a ghost, and ""The Wreckage,"" which make it seem like Vanessa has a death wish, are too disturbing for me. Vanessa almost comes off as a suicidal Goth at times, and that's just weird. This CD is very dark, making it too different from her first album. And there's nothing as catchy and radio-friendly as ""A Thousand Miles."" The melodies are usually upbeat and catchy, but the album seems bittersweet because of its depressing lyrics. I don't like this as much as her debut."	0
Based on a true incident, this tale of the escape of indentured workers from a fish packing plant in Alaska in the 1800s is hair-raising adventure. Doig's descriptions of the trials the men face in the unforgiving wilderness are masterful and vivid. There's humor here too. At first, the syntax was challenging, but Doig succeeds in giving the narrative a Scandinavian and historical flavor through the language. This boat takes some startling turns, so hang on!	1
These CO detectors are mandatory in many states now. I happen that the man who cleans my carpets is the Captain of the town fire dept (also up for promotion to chief), and he always points out my fire hazards or things I do or don't really need to do. I had my first CO detector up on the ceiling next to my smoke detector. He told me it di not need to be on the ceiling, and it's easier to get a plug in one so you don't have to worry about the battery aspect. Then incidentally my ceiling one broke somehow. So I bought this one, plugged it in, in the hallway near my bedroom......he said to do that so you can hear it quickly, and loudly. It's doing it's thing. A little pricey, but actually one of the cheaper ones. He approved!	1
"I saw this movie in the theater about 4 weeks ago. It, by far, has to be the worst movie I've ever seen.The acting is bad.The plot is thin. (Hello!?! A lesbian rape scene?)It serves as the perfect ""How to stalk Morrissey Guide.""I suppose this film was supposed to be a farce. It fails miserably. I laughed at places where there was supposed to be no laughter. I just couldn't help thinking that Morrissey would absolutely cringe upon seeing this film.I think it's great that Morrissey fans are going out and creating art, but this film misses the mark.Props to Jose M, who stars as Morrissey. He always looks good."	0
this movie, other than the scenes that depicted the actual game rollerball, was horifyingly (if thats a word) bad. do not see it! it is a huge waste of your moola.	0
"I thought that this set would be great for my two year old who loves blocks. WRONG! I found him with two magnets in his mouth one day. The brown rectangle came apart and the two magnets as well as the two black caps that ""hold them in place"" came out. The trees also have magnets on the bottom that can fall out. I am very disappointed with this product. Did the manufacturer really test this?!?!?! Not to mention that the blocks really don't fit together to build much of anything. Bottom line . . . DANGEROUS, DANGEROUS, DANGEROUS."	0
I have read this book once already and I am reading it agian right now. It is the most inspiring and motivating book that I have ever read. It seems that every time that I am loosing the sight of my spiritual path this book seems to pop up. I love it and recommend to every one, no matter if they are a spiritual person or not.	1
This video was dull and did not provide any information that I didn't already read in the books that I checked out from the public library for free. I'm fairly disappointed with my purchase and I feel that my money could have been better spent. I find the video rather pricey, but gave it a try because of a very enthusiastic recommendation from a friend. Needless to say, if you are the type of person who must have audio and visual to learn, steer clear of this and find an instructional video that's more concise. If you can learn through just reading, I highly suggest you just check out some books for free and save yourself some money. If you like long winded stories and have too much free time on your hands, this might be the video for you.	0
lent tailoring and quality. I personally prefer a little more cotton in the material. Still, a good buy.	1
"It's possible I've missed the point and, no, I haven't seen the comics but this movie has to be one of the most (only?) enjoyable in the ""demon"" genre. For the first half-hour I wondered whether I'd made a serious mistake. After that, I learnt to enjoy the ride and the laughs.I'm now entirely convinced the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek, entertaining and stimulating - in all of which it has succeeded. It definitely presses a few buttons and perhaps its detractors' funny bones were bumped a little too hard?"	1
I expected better than this poorly contrived story of murder and mystery from a well-seasoned author. The plot line lacked substance and the ending was poorly executed. The only reason I continued reading the story was in hopes that it would improve as I read. Boy, was I disappointed.	0
Well, I'm a batman fan. And this is for the one disc set. Heard there were problems with two-disc set but really doesn't concern me because I'm more interested in the movie than the extras. This movie contains a great extra, namely the first scene of The Dark Knight. I actually have to upgrade my dvd software to play that because it was so new and I'm glad I did because the picture was so sharp and clear. Begins cannot even compare. As a movie, you either love it or not. As a product, you cannot go wrong with blu ray. Once you go blu ray you never go back.	1
This review is not about the movie in general. There are enough of those here already. However the DVD was very dissapointing. Purportedly the sound was upgraded to Dolby 5.1 Surround. The sound instead is washed out and the volume difficult to maintain at one level. Often volume needs to be increased to hear the actors and then reduced again as the background music swells. Almost as bad is the video. It's as if they produced the DVD off an old, beat up print. Small flashes of white and black spots continually appear throughout the movie.I bought the DVD at a reputable retailer, but it plays like a bootleg.	0
Lackluster adaptation of the vertigo comic book that is only a fraction of the original source material and puts in a actor who can't live up to the character he is trying to play. Keanu Reeves fumbles badly with his role and the rest of the cast follows suite with the lousy script that make them all look like fools. Only Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare come out of this cinematic debacle with their heads high because they do more than the script does in this film. They give more to their respective characters than they should have and make the film a little better than it really is and that's no small feat considering the fact that Keanu and the rest of the cast do look like fools thou out the entire film thanks to the badly written script and lackluster special effects.For Rachel Weisz and Peter Stormare, the film gets a four rating. The rest of the film does not even merit one.	0
I got nothing out of this book. I've read many self-help books, and this is among the worst. McWilliams provided worn-out cliches, and the book reads slowly. If you want good selp-help books, check out Denis Waitley and Anthony Robbins.	0
This is a great cake dome -- it's beautiful and the price isn't bad! But I actually found it a few days after I used it the first time at Target for $15. I couldn't believe Target was cheaper than Amazon -- that rarely happens! So check there first. Still, I think it was worth way more than that, so if you don't find it there, definitely order here on Amazon!	1
Don't bother wasting your money. This book is slow and goes nowhere fast. I could not even finish the book.	0
Works as stated FAST, EASY, Just do it! Idiot-proof click, click, pop, ding your done! What more can you ask for?	1
One of the things that I like best about these movies (and about the Major League series as well) is that as a non-north american, and someone who doesn't follow or know anything about either of these sports, I can still enjoy these movies and even learn something. I often feel that they are underrated in how clearly they communicate the underlying foundation of the story, which is the sport, its rules, tactics, and language, without sacrificing the entertainment value. There is a reason why the Mighty Ducks movies keep getting repeated on Australian TV - they are inoffensive, pure entertainment.	1

A fan of Rinaldi, I was looking forward to reading this book. The original plot was set up well, but as I read on it became more gruesome and frightening with every page. Its title says it all: the book is just plain dark. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone not in for a horror story. Dead bodies, detailed accounts of hangings, nightmares, and assasinations are not what I look forward to in Ann Rinaldi's books.	0
I don't think much needs to be said. It's batman. The first movie to one of the greatest trilogies ever made, and if you're looking at this product right now, you pretty much have to buy it. And whoever I bought this from did a good job, super quick shipping.	1
i have a friend who loaned me a copy of this book and insisted i read it and spread the word... thank god i didn't spend money on it. the stories seem forced, almost like they were taken from real life experience and then re-told in such a way as to make them thoroughly unbelievable. i hope that the essays aren't all autobiographical, because they seem to come from a core of desperation that is just painful to read. this guy has potential but really needs to find his own voice and stop trying so hard... i might give his sophomore effort a try (if there is one) but i wouldn't waste the moolah on this one	0
This is a collection of some computer geek's wet dreams. The stories aren't even stories, they're just sex scenes. They are extremely bizarre and took a lot of imagination to create, I'll give it that. But the only person I think who would really enjoy this book is the comic book guy from The Simpsons. If you want a real story with some steamy scenes wrapped in, try Laurell K. Hamilton.	0
I dont know how you can say this cd is overated, it is underated if anything. This is brilliant group of musicians, who all have talent on their insturments that really shines through and compliments the group as a whole. This cd overall is awesome, not a bad track from start to finish. My favorite part about this cd (being a guitar player) is the guitar solos, this guy really knows how to craft the perfect solo to compliment the track, unlike most metal guitarists who just try to play as fast as they can and end up killing the mood of the track. If your looking for a truly awesome melodic/power/prog metal experience look no further. \m/	1
Long Live John Carter Warlord of MArs. When I was a kid and read this series, I wanted to be John Carter of Mars. Now I'm much older and still fascinated while rereading A Princess of MArs. Who can forget the opening part with John Carter lying in that Arizona cave and gazing at the strange red planet Mars while something behind him in the cave's darkness is stirring. What was that force that sent Carter to the red planet? And then there's his arrival in Mars and that strange green many-armed creature Tars Tarkas of the mighty green men of Thark. And then there's Dejah Thoris, the princess, a woman that words can't even begin to describe. What a babe. This book is still as good as it was back then. --Alex Sydorenko, Chicago, Sept 1999.	1
"First off, let me just say that I am a huge Michael Bay fan.From ""Bad Boys"" to ""The Island"",he has created some of the most exciting action sequences since the last decade,and ""Transformers 3"" is no different.I must admit that I did not like the first film-nor cared too much for the abysmal sequel that was ""Revenge of the Fallen"",but Bay finally got everything right for this installment.And the last 40 or so minutes is definitely worth multiple viewings.(The toppling building sequence impressed me tremendously),and the cast stays on point to where there are no weak links.Some credit has to be given to Rosie Huntington-Whiteley as Sam Witwicky's(Shia LaBeouf)girlfriend,who is actually alot more tolerable than Megan Fox.Long story short,I wish I had gone to go see this one,as it proves that Michael Bay is still fully capable at keeping our attention with off the wall action spectacles.Keep up the good work."	1
Okay, I did not buy this product. Nor will I. There has to be something wrong with the title of this video. If they mean little sister, then I think the correct pinyin form of it should be mei mei. Mimi means breast in Chinese. Are all the reviewers of this English only speakers, or has someone who actually speaks Chinese seen this video? I'm just curious if their pinyin is incorrect, then will their pronunciation of words be incorrect as well?	0
what the hell is it with americans? why cant they like GOOD music?> this band is awful, theres only one good song on this and that's the anthemic live forever, which is about the closest they got to a decent tune. every other song is idiotic, bash you over the head with a repeated riff rock that shouldn't ever be compared to the beatles EVER. the gallagher brothers are crap, in their attitude, their look and their songs. this is crappp. morning glory is a good album i admit, and that will be the only reason people care about them,,,,accept and move on	0
Interesting concept, some interesting characters, but too much. The language gets so heavy handed -- how many similes and metaphors can you take -- and melodrama, boy! At times this book was like reading the worst sections of Anne Rice's Violin over and over and over ... Yeah, yeah, yeah .. I got it already! Move on.	0
All I need to say about this item is buy gum at the store. way to much work and kneading of gum that tastes like you are chewing on plastic and rubber. Much cheaper too!!!!	0
WE just got this for our 21 month son and he LOVES it! My sister put it together so easily. And it stores very very small. He loves running in and out of it and crawling thru the tunnels. And the fact you can add to it is awesome. This was a great buy and the cheapest price by far on line!	1
"I was really excited about adding these to my cardio workout, just to add a bit of weight without feeling it too much. That was the idea anyway. The issue is they didn't fit well, and there was no way to adjust them. I'm a 6'1"" tall woman with the proportions to go with the height, so I'm not dainty. These were tight on my wrists from the start. I wore them a few times thinking with use the material would stretch a bit, but the material just came apart at the seams and the sand inside started to spill out. Even then it wasn't THAT tight, I wouldn't have thought it would just fall apart. Even if they did fit I imagine they wouldn't last very long.For smaller people these will work out fine, but for people who are more robust, including most men, these simply won't work out very well. I wish the adjustable kind came in lighter weights."	0
"THIS IS NOT A GREAT ALBUM. RAY-J LACKED A WHOLE LOT. MY SISTER WASTED HER MONEY, WE ALL DON'T LIKE IT, FIRST ALBUM IS MUCH BETTER. SECOND, I DON'T KNOW. ""WAIT A MINUTE"" WAS HOT. I WOULDN'T TAKE THE LAST COPY OFF THE SHELF. I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND TO AN R & B FAN. THE ONLY SONG ON THERE IS HOT ARE "" WHAT I NEED"" ""BLUE HIGH HEELS"" AND ""ONE WISH""."	0

"Just ""assembled"" the bat cave for my 5 year old. Pathetic construction and workmanship -- half of the gimmics don't work. Another pile of injection-molded plastic parts and stickers that I get to assemble -- what is this thing -- $4 of raw materials + $2 of shipping + $10 of marketing? Garbage. Shame on you Mattel, the only thing worse is the batman figures with the batarangs that take 30 minutes and a blowtorch to get out of the packaging. This batcave will collapse and die within hours of play, I'm sure of it. GARBAGE!"	0
I bought the plug package made by Apple for my Mac computer. It is very cleverly made to fit well on the current adaptor and an excellent travel accessory. I only wish that it were priced more reasonably in a package for each area of the world rather than a package for plugs used in many different countries, for a price to equal that package. As I am traveling only in Western continental Europe, I do not need several of the other plugs included, which seems an unecessary expense as well as being wasteful and makes for items I don't need.	1
"I purchased these for my 7-month-old. They are supposed to keep your baby ""dry"" for up to 12 hours (box states). I'd put these on our baby at 9 p.m. By 4 a.m. they'd be full to the point that they had wet his sleeper (so we'd have to change his clothes at 4 a.m. which did not help our sleeping routine.) I would buy something else and not spend the money on Pampers again. I am now using Parent's Choice diapers from Walmart and these work better for us."	0
I was literally pumping only 2 to 5cc (32cc make an ounce) for my newborn who was almost 5 days old when my lactation consultant told me to try this. Within days I noticed I was consistently pumping an ounce then gradually more, by day 10 I was barely supplmenting with formula. This stuff is like a miracle worker. Be sure to not drink anything before and after wards for at least 20 minutes. This makes the product more effect.Yes it taste pretty bad but order the alchol free and no problems. It's so worth it, it's for your baby. They deserve the best and our breastmilk is what's best for them.	1
Mr. Pratchett is a very good writer, and while not every discworld novel is a knock out, none have been bad. Of all of his work this is my favorite. I reread it at least every couple of months. Bruthra and Om [pointy horns] spin a tale quite entertaining that keeps me coming back. I only wish Mr. Pratchett had spent more time talking about the librarian/watcher monks. I hope you enjoy this book as much as I do.	1
"One of the LONGEST books I have ever read in light of number of pages, subject and time it took to read. But one of the most beautiful ""poetry/prose"" books ever written. I feel wonderful having finished it!"	1
I received this book as a gift from a friend who raved about it. I gave it an honest try, but I found this book unreadable. Maybe it's the translation from the original Greek text, but the sentence structure was very hard to follow. That being said, I found Zorba to be the type of person I would actively avoid spending any time with. Longwinded, drunken, sexist, and generally unpleasant. The narrator was annoying in his hero worship of Zorba, also. This book gave me a headache, and made my temples throb. I only gave it one star because Amazon doesn't allow negative stars. I found it to be awful.	0
"Complete Dreck. the first five minutes were pretty good but it went downhill rapidly after that. It has no redeeming social values: terrible acting, completely phony aerial scenes (reminded me of the first Star Wars battle), and inane dialogue.Wish I could say more but we turned this thing off after an hour of hoping ""it will get better won't it?"" It didn't......"	0
Nice set, very soft and comfortable, they are made slightly oversized and fit a thick mattress perfectly.A few strings came off them at first washing, but no unravelling or fraying.an excellent bargain at the $12 they cost me on clearance sale.	1
I wanted to read this before seeing the film. Wow, what a bore. Keel's book reads like some scatter-shot diary with himself as the narrator. Maybe this stuff was revelatory back when it was originally published, but now with the X-Files cultural phenomena and all the other media about UFOs and the paranormal floating around, this seems pedestrian in comparison. The descriptions are always the same. Only the names change each chapter/sighting/contacting.Also, DO NOT READ THIS BOOK before seeing the movie. It will sap some of your enjoyment from Mark Pellington's excellent film (in fact, I was amazed at how well screenwriter Richard Hatem took this dross and put a narrative structure around it, but that's another review that belongs elsewhere....)	0
Enjoyable, easy to read book. Great investment, tax and cost saving tips. Useful examples, both good (profits) and bad (losses) taken from experience. Lots of historical facts about stock market history. Well worth the price. I don't feel the book is the only book you'll ever need. Took about 6 to 8 hours to read.	1
I enjoyed reading this book. What was difficult to understand but the authors referenced with other materials to guide you along. If you are on your path to balancing your spiritual awareness, add this book to your collection.JAM	1
I am really enjoying this DVD. It answers everything you need to know and makes me feel like I know what to expect when the big day comes! I have watched this video over and over by chapters and take notes simply because it's hard to take in so much information at once. What made me happier was to see the couples in Sheri's group get together for a reunion after they had delivered. I would have liked to hear the couples experiences in delivery, though. I appreciate a light and easy going environment and attitude as she teaches this video.	1
and that is a reach.this Album has Easily His Best Music to date on it but the Cat can't Sing to Me&nothing every seems to change.now He is One Lucky Cat with all the Tribute Shows&Projects He gets to be down with.but as far as Being an Elite Artist?Don't Believe the Hype.thsi Album He is trying to tap into R.Kelly,D'angelo&Maxwell's World&Come up way short.	0
Bought as an inexpensive gift and got one for my self. Useful instructions and pictures in a compact source. .	1
I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller.	1
I love Pampers products and bought these with complete confidience but I was extremely disappointed.These diapers are awful, they do not hold anything and they caused my daughter to have a rash. I only wish I had bought Cruisers.	0
There were post office issues with the delivery of my product. I sent an e-mail to Amazon letting them know, and they had a replacement on my doorstep the next day. Really great customer service.	1
I decided to try these diapers instead of the swaddlers to save a few dollars. Needless to say that was a mistake. They claim to keep baby dry for up to 12 hours. My little one can't use these to sleep through the night (6 hours). I don't recommend these at all. Spend a few extra dollars on the swaddlers, you'll make your money back on the $ saved on extra laundry they cause because they leak.	0
"I have to agree with the ""lousy"" review. It seems to be a decent setup,but if you need a light more intense than any naturally available, what is the point? HP needs to get this fixed so it is much more sensitive to light and can operate with a faster ""shutter"" speed to prevent blur and also produce something other than an extremely dark picture. I wasn't looking for something that great with a 1.3 MP camera, but this was a total loss. Can you say Return Merchandise Authorization?"	0
Launcher broke after a couple of flights. Not surprising for the cost. These were popular when I was a kid and this model WAS enjoyable while it lasted.	0
Love this product, makes my skin look and feel great! It's easy to use, no mess no fuss. I don't use it everyday because I like to save it for the weekends because it makes my skin feel so good.	1
"This book was nothing what I expected. I can now understand where some of the great people of today came from. Tom writes as if he were in awe of these people. I know I was after I read the book. This book covers the time before and during WWII. You can see the people he writes about selling newspapers, building planes, women flying the planes. This is a really feel good book. You will come away feeling great about your relatives who lived during this time. This book answered many ""Why"" questions. If you have been lucky enough to live in a close family, this will give you the reason so many familys are close, and what true family values are all about. You have heard many politicians speak of this, but this book has the answer. I didn't put it down until it was finished. I don't like Tom, but I respect his writing ability and the way he presented this book."	1
I'm sorry, but I just couldn't stay awake to see this complete video. Whenever a cliche' scare comes up, I fall asleep....and this was often. I saw the original 60's version and, sorry, but that one was a snoozer too. I think this story could be phenomenally scary, but the right party has yet to make it.The only really scary thing about this movie is looking like Lily Taylor and having to share the screen with Catherine Zeta-Jones. She's a Goddess!!	0
This product comes in 2 parts held together with 4 screws. Unfortunately, one of the screw holes was not threaded and I had to tap it out with a 1/4-20 tap. I suppose someone got distracted on the assembly line. I don't think many people would have a tap set on hand to fix this themselves. I suppose I would have simply had to leave one screw off if I didn't cut the threads in the hole. Once I got it together, it worked fine. I prefer digital scales, but home digital scales just don't seem to last more than 6 months. This balance bar scale should last forever.	1
This is a great book for children doing research about Saints, especially particular Saints such as the first female saint of the Americas. A little pricey for the book, 6.00 would incld. ship would be a better purchase.	1
Works great. Got this one to upgrade from a normal/low definition unit. It is compact, easy to use, stylish and is a fine product from Tivo.	1
This was a very brief but very engaging story wonderfully read by Gary Sinise. It is very touching and I didn't want it to end the way it did but I knew it had to. Great Story.	1
"Hoping this ""unrated"" version will show something the original version didn't?Don't get your hopes up.As with a host of other recent ""unrated"" editions of theatrical turkeys (The Girl Next Door, Club Dredd, Eurotrip, The Chronicles of Riddick, etc.), there's nothing in this version to give it a ""harder"" rating -- it's unrated simply because the studio didn't submit THIS cut to the MPAA.Unless you really, REALLY want to see all the deleted scenes from your old DVD copy of ""Coyote Ugly"" re-cut back into the film, don't waste your time or money on this trick."	0
Whether you're a beginner or an expert, you're sure to find dozens of useful tips and insights. It's also a pleasure to read. Literate, up to date, and user-friendly. Only one caveat: it was written when OS 8.5 was still in beta, so in those sections your mileage may vary.	1
People often rave about how great this album is -- I really don't see the appeal. At the risk of sounding simplistic, this CD is full of pretensious songs for pretentious people. Bad melodies, not catchy at all, very little edge. Awful. There is so much good music out there, I can't fathom why one would listen to this.	0
This toy has peaces that fall off even while puting it together it kept falling apart the legs would not stay on and part of the tower would not stay together. I would not recomend this toy to anyone else or pay for it again myself.	0
This concert film stinks! The camerawork is worse than clumsy--it looks like something a spastic with a Handicam would have done. And the sound quality is horrible. It must have been wonderful to be at Hammersmith Odeon when this concert was performed, but it sure didn't translate well onto film. Listen to the recordings and skip this disaster.	0
I recently purchased both Hoopnotica Beginner Levels 1 and 2. I am new to hoop dancing and I watched both of these DVDs from beginning to end without hooping just to concentrate on the instructions. I think they are both excellent DVDs as they are very clear, organized and concise. If you are trying to decide on which one to get, I recommend that you start with the Level 1, but really you should get both. I plan to collect these as they come out, they are really that good. (Note that these aren't exercise routine DVDs - they are for learning the techniques of hoop dancing.)	1
They caused diaper rash. I changed to Huggies and they were gone. We have used pampers over last 6 years for my kids but i will never use Baby -Dry again.	0
Hickory is my favorite and that is what I use the most in smoking my meats. With Bradley Bisquettes does gives a lot of smoke and add flavor to the meats. I am never disappointed with Bradley Briquettes!	1
I have this on both DVD and video and there isn't that much difference. DVD you can skip the guitar solos though and get back to David... or pause perfectly. If you do buy a DVD though, make sure you don't have the surround sound on. It sounds much much better when it's just flat together. Although this isn't a concert like you'd see today, it's still entertaining, definitely a classic. Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders just go together. I've got friends that don't know Bowie, but do know Ziggy Stardust. This is a great band, wonderful character, wonderful songs, it all comes together despite the picture quality. You can definitely just put it on and watch it, or work on something and just listen to it. It is worth the buy, especially if you love David Bowie.	1
The Vicar of Wakefield is a wonderful book. A little slow going sometimes, but still a good read. Not only does it tell a story of a family but it also relates very well to real life moral and ethic values. It could almost be said to be inspiring. And definitely shows that the ends justifies the means.	1
So glad i started reading classics like this. Its about a little girl who grows up poor but she has reading to sustain her and help her get through the hardships of her daily living. This book will take you through a wide range of emotions and its worth every bit. This is absolutely one of the top 10 American books of all time!	1
"When Batman Begins was announced, I (like so many others) found myself saying ""oh no, not ANOTHER one!!!"" In fact, I didn't go see this one in the theater until it was almost released to DVD...one night on a boring business trip when I had nothing better to do, I strolled to the local theater and decided to check it out......and WOW.If you were tired of the Batman flicks of the '90's and how they got worse with each movie, do not fear. This one is leaps and bounds ahead of the rest (yes, even better than the first one with Jack Nicholson). Batman Begins is, in a word, incredible.Strong performances from Christian Bale, Liam Neeson, Morgan Freeman, Cillian Murphy, and others. A fabulous storyline that is much, much more than cheesy one-liners and ridiculous comic book style visuals and effects. And some great action sequences that will even make you say ""WOW"" in this era of super-sized special effects.A review can't do it justice...SEE THIS MOVIE NOW!!!"	1
This is not what i oredered, but this is the third time they continue to send them to me, dont know why	0
I have never read such a terrible book in my life. Let me refer you to the excelent book by Henri Gamanche THE MASTER BOOK OF CANDLE BURNING. It is a far superior text containing much more relaiable material.	0
If you happen to misplace the factory charger, this is the exact replacement you need for the cameras listed. There were no flaws in the product, and it came in safe packaging.The only problem is cost, but I wouldn't use an aftermarket charger so I was prepared to pay for the real thing. If you lose your Canon battery charger, go ahead and order this.	1
A vividly imagined tale of what might have been had the infamous Lucky Lucan (wanted for murder) come to Paris with his body double, settled in for overpriced psychotherapy with a former fake stigmatic and ultimately ended up sealing his fate in a most unexpected (and unbelievable) way. Although clever in places, witty in spots, I found this book a quick read primarily because I wanted to be finished with it quickly. The characters were brittle and unsympathetic. The scenes artificial. The book flowed like a swift stream, confident even cocky in places, but lacking the kind of depth that makes you want to dive in and swim.	0
After returning two malfunctioning HP960c printers due to frequent paper jams, we bought the HP940 hoping it would work better. It was worse. The paper jammed or was shredded every second page. It took a great deal of time to print even one document. We tried the more expensive HP paper and the paper jams continued at the same rate. We were unable to print any envelopes at all due to repeated jamming. It is clear that the paper feeding mechanism is defective in these HP printers.We've had HP printers for years with no problems. We were loyal HP fans; however, we've had to return THREE of their printers in the past few weeks. That's unacceptable. We just returned the HP 940 and bought a Canon S630. So far, no problems with the Canon--a relief!	0
Mind numbingly bad Keanu Reeves film that makes you want to tear your hair out with Keanu giving his career worse performance and most of the actors giving theirs as well. The story is a clear rip off of horror movies from the past and it makes even the viewer feel stupid after it's all over. Only Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou, and Peter Stormare are able to transcend their badly written characters and that's because they are too good of actors to be even in this mess.Hopefully Weisz, Housou and Stormare will learn to read their scripts better after this debacle.	0
As always a Maeve Binchy feel good story. Fast read but once I pickup any of her books, I cannot put down until I finish. Characters had depth. Would recommend any of her books.	1
I am a believer in many of Glasser's ideas and use his theory within my work. I was so excited to find a new discussion of cases because I had grown so much from <<Reality Therapy In Action>>. I received this book and upon reading the first page realized I was reading something I had read before. This book is the paperback edition of <<Reality Therapy In Action>>. I recommend the book to anyone who desires to be empowered and wants to see where you have more choices than you think. However, if you've read (or like me own) <<Reality Therapy In Action>>, check out something else by Glasser.	1
I think Izzy is very talented and I'm glad he's using his talent for Kingdom music. I didn't always feel like he gave his all in every song but the lyrics were great and a few songs really caught my ear. I can't say that it's my favorite cd, but I think it's a great way to round out any Christian's cd collection. I hope to see more from this artist.	1
Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.	1
Garbage has great potential, but honestly, I expected something better than this. The first disk was wonderful: every track was great, and you could listen to it forever. However, I quickly tired of this album. It doesn't have that many good tracks and you quickly tire of the ones that are.	0
Disk#1 - too few wordsDisk#2 - starts with based on reading; but there are no lessons on how to readetc	0
Yawn, yawn, yawn! I was forced to sit this this pile of crap. Who cares about an ageing homosexual who lusts after his hunky, straight gardener? I didn't care about the characters, and found them to be extremely annoying....especially Redgrave. What was she trying to mumble all the way through the film....who really cares? What a waste of two hours. Academy Award nominations? PLEEEEEEEASE! For what? If you run out of sleeping tablets one night, hire this sleep-inducing movie.	0
"One truly great song (the first on the disc) followed by 11 weird takes on Mexican folk music and depressing moans. The brilliant arrangement and accompaniment of the first song ""Mi Cara de Pared,"" a sexy, mournfully loping tango, led me to expect greatness within, but alas, Lhasa is a one-trick pony, one with a potentially great voice, which is reduced to strained yodelling on the subsequent uninteresting numbers. It's almost as if she were undecided what category she wanted to present herself in - is it world music? Latin? Pop? Rock? Unfortunately it seems to be none of the above. If I want Mexican folk songs, I'll call Linda Ronstadt. The arranger and producer (name forgotten) should have waited to present the CD when he had more tricks up his sleeve and the singer had better songs. A great disappointment - but that first number is a killer."	0
Not official NFL product but saved money and quality was good enough. This product will keep your head warm and show your Team pride.	1
I guess I downloaded this book by mistake. I got to chapter 6 and that's as far as I could take the unbelievable story. I could see nothing funny and I have a great sence of humor. I gave it a 1 star because there is nothing lower. Sorry, wish I could return the book, but it's been too long, just got around to reading it.	0
I like to watch true story. It made me cried in the end that Albert died & left wife w/ 9 kids.	1
I love period films, but I did not enjoy this one. The plot was thin, I thought the acting was well done.	0
So many reviewers have done such a great job in their descriptions that I don't want to rehash the story again. Big whale, little ship, cannibalization, fascinating characters - all great elements to create a compelling story.This is not the typical genre that I gravitate toward, but I found myself unable to put this book down. The descriptions of the whaling society in Nantucket hooked me from page one - and the story just would not let go. I really don't care for gross out books, and to be honest if I had realized how much of that was in this novel, I would have passed it over. That would have been a mistake.	1
I bought this product according to the good reviews and its not worth your time and money. The product feels like putting a piece of cheap tape and nothing coming out. Dont buy this product!! Its very cheap!!	0
We bought these for my daughter to start school. They are classic, cool and don't cost a fortune. The conversion from men's to women's sizes was accurate. They hold up much better than knock-offs of the same style. Also Amazon makes things so easy, my mother wanted to get my daughter something to start school & didn't have time to shop. I went to my daughter's wish list & because I have shopped Amazon for my mother before I had all her information. I was done in 3 minutes.	1
It's marginally better than the second of the series, with action sequences that border on coherent, but just a few minutes in it's already pointlessly foolish, and doesn't do much to redeem itself over the next few hours. Big robots, smash smash smash. Whatever.	0
I don't know want the book is about yet Hahaha so can I read now? Thank you ? This is I don't know	1
"doprah picks a book that should be ousted from the canon. (shot from it?) there's no melody, as it were, in this text. (yes, it's more of a text--hence, chore--than a book). magic realism=jiggery-pokery. you don't care about the characters as it's incredibly difficult to visualize them--and then you find that scads of them have the same name. ontology recapitulates...nonsense. you want something fantastical, go to Angela Carter. this guy spawned Salman Rushdie's awful indulgent junk, man. (although i remember ""love in the time of cholera"" being an all right read. double-yucky!"	0
On the surface, this book offers startlingly beautiful language and heart-stopping imagery. But its offerings merely begin there. Levine, a master of metaphor and tone, uses these 18 surreal parables to critique power dynamics and to expose the oppressive mechanisms of family, relationships, body and gender. Often simultaneously funny and disturbing, these stories will resonate years after a first reading. Her expert use of the surreal is often called Kafka-esque, an overused and misused literary cliche that, for once, fits the bill. Her keen grasp and expression of humanity's politics precisely suits the Kafka legacy. Her expert use of language and imagery remind us that writing really is an art.	1
Good programming books are not rampant. Manning tends to be a great source, however. They've done it again with this book. And, this time, they have the added attraction of a great, adult sense of humour with Shawn Bayern. If you cannot use JSTL with ease after reading this book, then you will be in the minority. I don't know if Bayern makes the hard easy or the easy easy, but it definitely is made easy. I sailed through this book wondering how 400 plus pages could seem like 90 pages. The best thing is that there is a forest for the trees to live in throughout this book. Bayern is a great teacher. I'm going to look at his other book now. Maybe it is good too.	1
I bought this Tivo network adapter after buying another type and spending 3 hours trying to get it installed and working and on the phone with customer service.I knew I should of bought the tivo adapter right from the start. As soon as I received it, I plugged it in the back of the tivo and within minutes I was all set.what a waste of time my first purchase was. I took it back to the store the next day.I would highly recommend this tivo adapter. I have not had any problems with it and the installation is the easiest.	1
I'm not sure I heard the same CD the other Amazon.com reviewers heard. No swing, no pop, no fun, from my POV. I'm going to see what I can do to get my money back on this one; as a last resort, there's always the used CD store that might buy it from me, or else I can add it to my stack of coasters. The best thing this CD can do for me now is prevent unsightly water spots on my side table.	0
I've been in love with Shirley Manson since I saw the video for 1995's Only Happy When It Rains. Since then, I've never been once disappointed with her or the rest of the band especially when it comes to this CD. Version 2.0 is an amazing blend of techno and guitar melodies. I'm totally convinced that every year Garbage just gets better and better.	1
I've been reading the Discworld books in order of publication, and this is the first one that diverged from the normal types of stories. This book was a pretty strong expression of Pratchett's religious stance, in my opinion. The humor wasn't as strong as other books, I thought it was almost more of a philosophy book, or a book of opinions on religion. I wasn't sure how to rate this as I enjoyed the views on religion, but thought they would be better written in a non-Discworld novel. For Discworld, I didn't think the storyline was very fitting. I'd probably give it 3.5 stars, but rounded up as well. If you're looking for Discworld humor, I wouldn't choose this book. If you want some views (primarily mocking) on religion, then it's good!	1
I tried really to follow the story...the names are all the same,I kept constantly referring to the family tree to figure out who was who...it's more science fiction than believable...insominia disease of the entire village?!, Just too difficult for me to enjoy. I hated it and only got as far as 158 pages before I gave up.	0
"Many people do not know that this is only part of a 60 volume serial.The main reason most people are confused about what is happening is a lack of understanding about internal energy or ""Chi"". This is the magic of the Orient. Many various legends of certain types of ""secret"" Kung Fu have existed for centuries in China and the chinese audinces are not so confused by the plot line.If you suspend you dis-belief this is a fantastic, fuuny, deadly serious, bloody tale of sweat revenge; betrayal and ultimate victory for the underdog. I can't find a better movie that works on all these levels.The english sub-titles are washed out by the background in some frames but can be gleaned if the movie is watched enough which you are sure to do."	1
A DJ aquaintance of mine told me that 'Arular' always got the crowd up and dancing, and in a way, I can see why. Central to this electronic beatfest is M.I.A's sassy vocals, falling somewhere in between Madonna and Lene Lovich (the Neneh Cherry comparison is pretty good) all within the framework of hip-hop rhyming. There's really no need to over-analyze the music, which is basically infectious stripped-down beats, eg, LCD Soundsystem, pulsating, raw and tribal, almost hailing back to the crushing barebones approach of early hip-hop, eg, Grandmaster Flash. Also thrown into the mix is a subtle yet ecclectic fusion of analog flash, dancehall, and world music. But basically the appeal of 'Arular' stems from the charm and sexuality of M.I.A's vocals, orgasmic shrieks and brassy chants, a female touch when one expects male vocals to compliment the rhythmic thunder. Here she is now, let M.I.A. entertain you.	1
Fahrenheit 451 in my mind is a very well-written book by Ray Bradbury. Sometimes this book did get very weird, but it all had a purpose towards the end of the book. The author of this book had a very good idea for a story like this and he wrote it very well.Guy Montag has had his job for ten years as a fireman, but books were for burning and the houses in which they were hidden. This man goes out on midnight, runs and watches pages become inflamed in fire. Then he meets a professor that tells him in the future when people could think, and then he realizes what he has to do.I enjoyed this book quite a bit and I would recommend this book for you if you like Science Fiction.	1
Purchased this watch to wear to a semi-formal party to coordinate with my white gold and diamond accessories. Perfect blend. I love all of the Eco-Drive watches becauses they recharge. I normally wear an 8 inch bracelet and this watch was a perfect fit. I would have preferred a wider watch, but this gives a very dainty look, especially nice for semi-formal wear. Great Price! Arrived on time.	1
I have purchased this matress 3 weeks ago. The price is pretty affordable, and it actually looks like a normal bed. At the beginning it leaked a bit, but after that (I really don't know why) it was ok. It is pretty comfortable. The built-in pump works very good and very convenient in use. The only two things are that I don't like in this matress are that one side of this matress is higher by 2-3 mm than another. And when you sleep on it you feel like there is a small angle. I mean the matress is not 100% horizontal. Another thing that peaces me off is the noise that comes from the matress when you move or somehow turn over. But overall it is good substitution if you need a temporary bed.	1
I got this toy for easter. From the comercials I thought the toy would be an action game like a pokemon where it would be in color and I would meet other animals and play with them. But it seemed to be just like those Giga-pets and Tomaguchies. You would get to costomize your pet like what the personality is, but that is the only difference between that and a Giga-pet. The game is completely black and white. One of the things in the game that I didn't like was that you needed to feed your neo pet at certain times of the day and if you feed your neo pet later than that certain time it dies. I would suggest buying it over summer vacation becasue if you don't you'll have to feed it during school.	0
"Is it just me...or is there something strange about the sound of this album, as though the musicians are all slightly out of tune or it's being played on a tape recorder that's going a little bit below the usual speed? This effect is particularly noticeable on ""TOLEDO"".I loved ""Painted From Memory""- I think the songs are fantastic. These versions don't detract from them, but, with a couple of exceptions (e.g ""Painted from Memory"", sung by Cassandra Wilson) they don't add much to the original album either. I had hoped that this CD would be more jazzy and improvisational. After all Bacharach and Costello have provided some great chords for jazz musos to play around with. Instead the instrumentation is dull and the arrangements unadventurous. Particularly bad is ""God Give Me Strength"", which on all other recordings is amazing."	0
This game was fun when I got it I was looking forward to getting home and getting started and straight away you will notice that the graphics for this game are great I mean I thought that (and sorry if I spoil it for anyone)and the voices are really hard to tell the difference from the real cast ( but I do think the voice of barbossa was here not sure)I also thought that the battle seens where there are those real fast sword clashes were great.Faults:well trying to use your gun and throwing knives is impossible to aim even with a area filled with enemys.also flashing from character to character was a little annoying but at times it was fun.Overall:well a good thing about this game is that it isn,t a simple button masher it actually has a lot of combos such as being able to punch and throw them around I esplcially like the ability to knee people in the nuts so it was really fun. but with very minor faults no game is perfect	1
Bland rip off of a great comic book not only puts the worse actor imaginable for the main character but has a script that is almost a crime in itself. The dialog is so bad that it would even make deaf children cry and the special effects are not as good as one might hope. Some of the acting is great and that's a great feat in itself because of how bad the script is. Rachel Weisz, Djimon Hounsou and Tilda Swinton do great work here and for that, people should be grateful for but it's still Keanu's film and he still torpedo it with a lousy performance that is in tune with the lousy script it has.If this is the best they have to offer for the fans of the comic book, then take it back.	0

The title say it all. This Exuviance-Vespera Bionic Serum the only brand I trust to my skin. I'm using this product for about ten years now my skin looks youthfull than ever. I'm glad this product is always available. I recommend this to my friends and family, after only few applications they notice the amazing results on their skin. I thank the company for marketing a real skin care that trully works. I will not use other product except this Vespera Bionic Serum.Marietta Parry Exuviance - Vespera Bionic Serum	1
Trick or Treat sounded like a great book from the blurb on the cover, What I found was vile and disgusting. I kept reading thinking it must get better. But no. It never got better. What I found was that the ending proved how really poorly written this book is--the author had multiple threads going. At the end, she dealt with none of them and ended on an improbability that only left more improbabilities. This is the only book I've ever consigned straight to the trash.	0
Camika was always serious at ETSU, so to see her actually write a book with humor almost sent me to my grave. I enjoyed the book and it's good to finally see the author relax and live a little. I never thought she'd be an author either. All she ever did that made her smile was play Spades. The book was all that and I'm really just glad to know that I know someone who is taking the bull by the horns and following her dream. Hey Camika, remember that water gun fight with the Omegas and the time we kidnapped the guy we thought was on line for Alpha? Those were the days. I'm a supporter for life! Oo-oop!	1
"The title of this book should have been, ""Java for C/C++ Programmers"". It is mostly a comparison of C/C++ programming to Java, heavy on the C part. But that is not the only problem. The author's writing style is more aimed at puffing up his own image than simple exposition of the subject. On page 91 he states, ""In 1993, I coined the term 'Bubbabyte' to describe 2^64 bytes. Just as 2^10 bytes is a kilobyte, [...] so 2^64 is a Bubbabyte."" He should have coined the term 'BubbaBrain' to describe himself. A much better book is ""Core Java, Vol 1"", by Cay S. Horstmann, Gary Cornell."	0
"I read through the first 50 pages of this book, and I couldnt keep up with all the characters. I Did not read the first book ""The Secret"", and maybe it would have been easier to keep up with if I had. Either way, it was just way too confusing."	0
While walking to the counter to PAY for this release, I turned it over to read what extras were included. NONE!!!!! Nothing!!!! I put it right back on the shelf. I am NOT paying full price for a bare-boned release! The greedy corporate thugs are counting on you to buy this, only to wave something a lot more enticing in front of your eyes when sales for this dwindle! Sick of these rip-off tactics!!! I have no sympathy for their loss of revenue from movie pirating! If they treated their customers with respect, perhaps the problem would not be so widespread!!!	0
'The Dracula Archives' is an excellent book that will appeal to all lovers of vampire fiction and lore. It is written in the style of a series of diary entries that is quite convincing. One almost wishes to believe that it is a factual account. The book is old now but definitely worth reading. Highly recommended to sit alongside your Bram Stoker's 'Dracula' and Anne Rice collection.	1
Vanessa Carlton proves once again that she not only is an amazing musician, but that her voice is certainly unique.The second album from Vanessa 'Harmonium' is a fantastic blend of pop, classical and orchestral music, not to mention the blend of rock.A great album with something for everyone.White Houses - the albums first single opens the CD with a great flow of upbeat tracks where Vanessa's pianist skills shine gradually changing to a line of slow amazing chill-out songs.A great album written based on real life experience, you'll be hooked!Also a great CD-Rom documentary following the recording of the album.Highly recomended and a great second mature album!	1
I have been using Pampers Cruisers for the longest. One night I ran out and I had to run to the store to buy some more. They did not have the Cruisers but instead had these. I purchased them thinking if I had as much success with the Cruisers then these should not be much different from those. W R O N G !! I couldn't wait to get rid of these !! EVERY Morning my son would be soaked through the diaper, sheets all wet, and very smelly ! These hardly hold anything through the night ! The name is not fitting what so ever ! I actually can't believe that Pampers would even put their name on something like this ! The diaper is thin, cheap, and honestly a headache! If you want something that is guaranteed to hold through the night, without any of these problems, go with the Pampers Cruisers ! Because these right here are a total waste of money, manufacturing, and time ! Major Fail !!!	0
This film is a great action movie hands down. no arguments. But another great thing about it is that the story and plot are rich and thick. I love when films like these use religion correctly to create a good story line. I myself am a fan of the Exorcist movies and Religious movies like those are good dark scary fun.	1
A must read for supervisors and managers. With outstanding proven approaches to knowing what you want from a conversaton, what the other wants, and watching out for the relationship. Found it useful at work as a reference book, plus a great read for personal relationship communications as well. Would suggest reading Crucial Conversations first to really get the full view.	1
"This film was a major disappointment. I expected so much more from the director of freaking ""Die Hard"". The direction, acting, and writing were all a joke. This film left you with the feeling that it was all just thrown together, and no one took it that seriously. There were lots of things in this film that just didn't make any sense at all. Someone explain: Why was that desert chase scene filmed in night vision? WHAT IN THE HECK WAS UP WITH THAT?! The editing was choppy and scenes were just thrown together. I gave this film two stars for one reason: The skateboarding scene at the beggining was sorta cool. Thats about it.SKIP IT. ""Rollerball"" is a loser."	0
This game is the worst Nickelodeon game I have ever played. It has horrible graphics and I don't think it portrays any Nickelodeon character at all.	0
witch of blackbird pond is a very well written book. it goes into much depth about certain things, however, i feel that is one of the reasons it is only a 2 star book. this book tells a story about a girl who moves into america before the revolutionary war. she has to saty with her only remaining relatives, who do not share the same points of veiw as she, kit tyler, does. kit is acused of being a witch but in the end can not be proven of her suspected withcraft. this book, yet well described, is streched out over to many pages. a lot of unesscesary things go on that one should not need to know. witch of blackbird pond has no real point to me and is a LONG and DULL book	0
I enjoy Asmov's science books. They are informative, clever and witty. But his science fiction is another matter. They are poorly written. And worse, I didn't believe a word of Foundation. Such accutate prediction is impossible. It's not only extremely difficult to predict the major trends, but to have his character predict such minor details as well is absurd. Just one example of the difficulties of prediction: Isaac Asimov, a well informed and very intelligent man, missed the computer revolution, though it was already under way when he wrote Foundation.	0
So it was long, and it was a slow read, big DEAL. Ms Lackey and cohorts have spun a gripping, involved tale of GREAT characters, involved PLOTTING and lots of FUN. I read for pleasure and this was a pleasure. I was always looking back to keep things straight, but it was FUN. I lost most of two nights sleep because I couldn't put it down. This team should write lots of sequels, and I WILL BUY THEM ALL.Be warned, if you pick up this book and start reading you will suffer. Yours friends and family will think you have run away, and you have, To Venice, where you can spend a ripping vacation in you mind. The lady has won me back.	1
I was hoping to find detailed instructions for selecting vinyl siding and installing accessories like soffits, trim, adding insulation, etc. I already know the basics of hanging vinyl siding. I found a lot of the instructions and many of the diagrams confusing. I found the FREE planning guides and installation instructions from the siding manufacturers more helpful. At $14.95 it is not worth the money.	0
This is a Graber guadian 3 ike rack, NOT a Saris guadian 3. I purchased it and it looks very simular, but has no anti-sways and the straps are a hard cheap plastic. I called the company and they said all they could do was have me send it back and get my money back. I informed them that the pictures on the advertisements were not of the one they sent me and they just said if I was unhappy with my purchase, I could return it. This was a week ago, and as I see they still advertise the Saris with anti-sways and rubber hold down straps. BEWARE of this company!!!!	0
I was delighted to get a copy at last.It started of fairly well,getting realy hard to read toward the end.Being such a long time hunter in the African bush I wondered why he could not fill the book with his exciting experiences.Which I am hoping he must have plenty. One thing I must mention here I am sure John Taylor is a proffessional butthroughout this book I am greatly disturbed abouth his continiues comments good and bad about the other great elephant hunters.I personaly think that,it takes a lot away from this book and its reading pleasure.	0
This was sent to me by mistake. So free it was but not a bargain.I dislike this imported 2 disc, 40 tract album very much. The is from the 30's I would think. With high quality headphones this stuff is to hard to listen too.The sound is very thin and hissy. Fidelity is low and overall listen-ability is very weak. This big band stuff without the big band sound. Song after song, it all sound the same, very boring material with sound to match. Just a throw-away.	0
I have never bother to write one of these review but I agree that the video is too advance for beginners and I find it difficult to get over the fact of what a poser she is. She seems to be cashing in on surfing and going after a niche market in yoga DVDs. I have watched and done all three DVDs and I have seen much better yoga DVDs. I sold these DVDs because they aren't the best out there. Check out the Living Art series of DVDs. I found these much better then the whole series of yoga for surfer. Go mindfully and slowly. Peace	0
"I found this movie pathetic at times. The drug use and plot line was, at times, absurd. I wish I hadn't wasted my $ renting this b/c it just wasn't worth it. The director's failed attempts at being ""artsy"" with the alligator, iguanas and the like was obvious and remedial and any action to be David LynchY was lost on practically anyone except perhaps the director.As you may surmise, this won't be one in my permanent library."	0
I am a big Steve Berry fan and have read all of his books. This one is controversial and makes you think about thesubject. Very well written and I look forward to reading his future books.	1
"""Of Mice and Men,"" is a gripping story about two men who are wondering through life, from dead end job to dead end job, with only each other to rely on. George, a bright man and clearly the leader of the two, and Lennie, as the book puts it ""a gentle giant,"" dream of a simple life of one day owning their own land. In a line of work that does not often lend itself to forming such close personal relationships, the two men are able to use each other as a support system to some how make both of their lives a little better.Steinbeck perfectly describes each scene placing the reader right in the action. One almost becomes the third stooge in the story. Each chapter builds upon the suspense, ultimately culminating in an ending that does not disappoint!"	1
My wife and I are both redheads, so we were really looking forward to reading this book. It is absolutely terrible. It is vulgar, anti Christian with no redeeming qualities. My wife could not even finish it. I read the whole thing hoping that it would get better. It did not. I sure hope that it never makes the library.	0
These pampers are not good quality as compared to same brand product available on any other retailer store. The problem with these pampers are the poor absorption and also the velcora waist is not good quality. I would not recommend for future buy.	0
"I was highly disappointed with this cd. Perhaps I expected more of the Kharma era Sanders or any of his early 70's releases. Anyhow I've always experienced Sanders as somewhat of a self indulgent artist even on his best records and in fact some of his best playing really is on other peoples records so in some ways I'm not all that shocked at the medocrity of this cd. The music is bland, overwrought and trite somewhat similiar to any of the faceless and equally uninspired New Age releases that you might stumble upon. This cd should be avoided and if you want to here some more current Sanders check out Sonny Sharrocks album ""Ask The Ages"" that features Sanders without the pretension and self importance."	0
Simply put, it does not keep my beverage hot or very warm. I've tried using different mugs and this thing is just not doing to the job. I read all the reviews before purchasing and gathered that I might have to try different mugs but that was not the case. The only reason I give it two stars is because it happens to keep my hot beverage warmer a bit longer (3 mins maybe?) than it would if I didnt have the warmer but in the end it cools down just the same. I would not purchase again.	0
These looked wonderful and were a birthday present for a close friend. When they came the foil was all stuck to the candy. We tried to unwrap a couple and it made a bigger mess with the paper sticking terribly to the candy. In the end we were able to taste the tiniest piece which just made us more disappointed and angry since it was delicious. We would never order these again or do business with this company. And living in Florida was not the problem since we paid BIG prices for the candy and shipping, it was not hot and the package was literally put in our hands from the truck, so it didn't sit outside. Big Big disappointment.	0
I was replacing my old cook book & I thought this was the same one but it isn't but it is a nice cook book.	1
This movie really left me cold. Just couldn't feel any empathy with the characters. In fact, I kinda ended up rooting for the monsters! I mean, here they are in their cave, maybe venturing out to snack on the odd lost kid or something. Then these adventure-seeking bimbos show up and act suprised when the monsters want to make them part of the buffet! Hey, who's on who's turf, huh? Does have some nice moments of suspense-building, but overall not a satisfying experience.	0
The book was in perfect condition, however, it didn't come with the user access code for internet review websites.	1
Mckellen does such a poor job in this movie..ofcourse it is easy to act gay when you are in real life..Brendan Fraser is the only decent actor in the entire movie and to think that he was in Encino Man...	0
"Hey, I just wanted to let you know that there's something wrong with this listing. The ""Make Sure It Fits"" feature claims that #27302 will fit 2008 and newer E-150s, when the manufacturer claims that it does not and the proper one is #27344. Just call them to check and make sure that it actually fits your vehicle before you buy."	0
Two years, and this is all we get? The first song is decent. It has some rap/reggae guy doing his vocal thang, with RDJ's music behind the background. Except for the first 10 seconds, the music itself exceptional. Nice crazy d'n'b stuff with vocals. This song is worth getting, but not for $$$ ! The other two tracks... they are just noise. It's as if he hooked up electrodes to his recording equipment and twiddled with the knobs or something. Or maybe he had real songs and then encrypted them. Who knows! They are not music. They're most likely a sick joke by RDJ.	0
but seriously,i laughed so hard watching this movie, that stuff came flyin outta my nose. It's wayyyy better than Sandler's last 4 projects, which really weren't that funny. Well, okay, mr. deeds was kinda funny....anything with steve buschemi....i digress.if you're a first timer and you're expecting some serious dramatic moments, then good news, there's a walrus in the movie which plays the part to perfection.on the whole, really funny, good ending...kinda bittersweet, okay i cried - so sue me!what's the movie about? good question.let's see if i can answer that in a few sentences...pineapple, amnesia, beach boys and a walrus :D	1
"I have to qualify this review with the following disclaimer... I never followed the comic book series or cartoons as a kid or teen. I'm just an adult female who LOVES movies, especially superhero flicks. Now, with that said, I have never been a fan of the Batman franchise. I found the earlier Batman films, despite their all-star credibilities, be ""over the top"" in every deparment (set, acting, dialogue). As a fan of Christian Bale, however, I was anxious to see the Batman Begins installment. Bale is an amazing actor, even in his younger days with Empire of the Sun to much later with American Psycho or a little more recently with The Mechanic. This was the finest of all the Batman films - darker and with more depth. It was good enough for this non-Batman fan to purchase for my home collection."	1
Evidently, the good news anchorman has been watching a little too much Saving Private Ryan lately. Naturally, the book gloats with little restraint over this generation's stance against fascism, neglecting its evident shortcomings as a nation half-governed by Jim Crow laws, or the social preception of the proper role of women as being confined to the household. Simply utilizing the fact that this generation took such actions that would easily have been undertaken by any sane people under these circumstances as an excuse to decry other generations as less worthy is grossly unfair. Yet, given Tom's journalistic background, his embellishments is hardly surprising. If anything, this book is testimony that history can only be properly evaluated by historians, not the news media.	0
James Herriot's Favorite Dog Stories is a short but delightful book written by the world famous veterinarian. It is beautifully illustrated by Lesley Holmes.This book consists of ten stories from Herriot's previous books that feature dogs that he has treated over the years. It's difficult to pick a favorite as they all have amazing personalities. There is Brandy, who is such a scrounger that he gets his tongue stuck in tin cans that he digs out of the trash can. TrickiWoo, a Pekingese, picks winning horses at the races. And Gyp, an epileptic sheepdog, only barked once in his entire life. Although all the dogs have special characteristics, it is obvious that it would take a veterinarian with compassion and humor to see that these animals are more than just pets.I truly enjoyed Favorite Dogs Stories. However, if you've already read Herriot's other books (which I haven't), you will find that they're repeats.	1
"I am a huge fan of Sophie Kinsella and normally love her books under the name of Madeline Wickham, too. This book, however, drove me nuts! I only made it about 1/4 of the way through before I returned it to the store - luckily I hadn't cracked the spine, and they took it back and refunded my money. This book is so terrible that I couldn't even make it past the first 1/4 of it - the characters were horrible, shallow people, and the plot is so see-through. Clearly, this book is one of Sophie's earlier works - the ""plot"" is terrible. Don't waste your money - don't take a chance in case you crack the spine - you won't be able to return it! Spend your money on one of Sophie Kinsella's novels instead - ""Remember Me"" is hysterical and a great, easy read. ""Cocktails for 3"" is painful trash."	0
We first checked this book out at the library. My child, 2 at the time, giggle and laughed, especially when the dog licks the boy's hand. We had to buy our own copy. I later used this book with a neighbor boy who was terrified of dogs. It showed him that the little boy in the book gave the dog a chance and so should he. It helped a bit. The writing in the book is easy to follow, on a child's level and the pictures are darling. Highly recommend this book!	1
"These leak so bad. Any time my 1 yr old goes number two, I have to change his clothes and mine. His PJs are soaked around the diaper if he sleeps through the night. I am terribly disappointed. I love pampers swaddlers for babies and thought I would try these to save some money, well no money was saved because I feel like I use double the diapers to keep my ""baby dry"""	0
I was really looking forward to being able to take care of neopets away from my computer but was VERY disappointed!	0
I ordered a 3X, because that's the size that the website said to order, it came and lacked about 8 inches closing....so I looked at the package and it says I should have ordered a 5x...seemed extreme, but I exchanged it.I was very impressed with the speed of the exchange, I'll say that....However, when the 5X arrived, it's so big it just gaps and falls off? So, was the 3X mislabeled, or is this 5x mislabeled? I'm needing something with some firm support for post surgery care....so I really don't know what to do at this point?	0
This is a nice trainer but it's noisier than expected. It's also not that convenient to put a bike in and take it out but if you can leave it up somewhere and not switch bikes very often it will work well. Overall we are pleased with it.	1
"100 Years of Solitude is an amazing story where reality and fantasy meet in the lives of the Buendias. Throughout the history of this one family, it is hard to tell what is fact and what is fiction. The best comparison would be to ""Big Fish"" in which the stories are tall-tales, but yet not without fact. All in all, I recommend this book to everyone."	1
Anyone who likes Limp Bizkit and Tool but suspects that these guys are basically talentless screamers needs to dig up System of a Down. Intelligent metal isn't an oxymoron...here is an abulm that shakes your bones while stimulating your mind. Amazing.	1
"Mr. Southall has provided an excellent reference book for both the professional and amateur ghost hunter / paranormal investigator! In this book, terms and definitions are explained in easy to understand language...the author doesn't need to use ""big words"" to make himself appear intelligent. It is very clear that immense amounts of thought, effort and experience went into this book. Most definately a must-have!!!"	1
Dale carnegie wrote very well in his earlier works, this later work (assumedly from later in his life, or judging from the text possibly written postumously) is the worst thing i have ever seen in print.As an english professor it seemed sardonic to me to see someone write so poorly about the topic of speaking well. Perhaps i should have read this garabage aloud instead.	0
"Sodom Came, they went.I had listened to 'Masquerade In Blood' and 'Till Death Do Us Unite' and I knew the war that was Sodom was over, the ceasefires had been signed. When you end an album with a song called ""Hey Hey Rock 'n' Roll Star"" after putting out crap that just screams ""We wanna be punk and are failing miserably at it!"" I knew it was over. Saddened, I went to survey the damage.And That's when I heard the Air Raid Sirens.Code Red is the comeback album of all time. Sodom has snapped back into place, I don't know why, but they're rocking harder and heavier than they ever have. This is not for ""Limp Bizkit"" fans, you get your ears and a greater part of your head ripped off and handed to you. And that's the way it should be.Notable Tracks are Liquidation, The Vice of Killing, Code Red, and Addicted to Abstinance."	1
"I like their first album too, but this one has a more electronic-oriented tracks, my favorite is ""When I Grow Up."" The even better part is that last fall they were on tour with my favorite band, Lit, and it turned out it was of da hook."	1
I was recommended this book by a family member. I'm going to be honest, this book is really bad. The main character is a Mary Sue type character (she can do everything perfectly, tame horses, etc) and it's like a Harliquin romance novel - because there's so much sex in it. This book was a complete waste of time.	0
I had 3 of these shirts in my cart and saw the reviews and just took these shirts out of my basket. Thanks all for the warning. Bill Blass, Hmmmmmmm, I thought they made quality merchandize. Live and learn.	0
It's exactly what I expected. It keeps my water at the right temperature all the time, not too hot, not too cold. Can't live without it in the office.	1
I truly enjoyed this book, it gives a humanity to the people I have read of in scripture and has a wonderful flow. While no substitute for the bible, it is helpful to remind me that real people face real decisions throughout history.	1
this is a horrible book! please dont read it!!! the story makes no sense and is VERY< VERY far fetched!	0
Sound quality is good for such an inexpensive item and long enough to let me move freely around in my office. Meets my needs	1
This book is awesome! Dali is no doubt one of the greatest artists of the 20th century! Smoked some bud too no doubt!! hehe	1
"I rented this film because I'm a huge Morrissey fan. I knew nothing about it, but was excited to check it out nonetheless. I am usually not one to write scathing reviews, but I must agree with the reviewer who stated that this was one of the worst movies he or she had ever seen... Very rarely funny, My Life With Morrissey is a mixture of stupid ideas, redundant jokes, bad camera work and poor movie making. While watching the film (and I did force myself to watch the whole thing) I kept thinking, ""If this was a college film project and these were my friends, I would probably find it humorous... But I don't know these people, so it's just annoying."" It's not that I'm some humorless Morrissey fan upset about the portrayal of Moz and his fans, it is just that the movie is simply not good. If you REALLY want to experience this movie, by all means rent it -- don't spend your hard earned dollars on it..."	0
Frankly, in reading the negative reviews it is clear to me that there is a growing body of illiterates among us. It seems too, that the more a book makes one think the more negaive review it receives from some readers.I do agree that this particular Kindle edition is cumbersome to navigate due to the format but it is still an exceptional book and very worth reading. Not only is the character developmet quite thorough and enjoyable but it gives us a glimpse of the society in which it was written. What I always find fascinating is that this, like most other classics, is about human nature, power and the consequences of actions. So in the end these themes are enduring and feed our desire to look into the hearts and souls of others- to be voyeurs-which is what makes a classic a classic.	1
I can not say enough about Nightwish, masterpeice in all meanings of the word. If I had to chose one CD to be stranded with on a desert island, this is it! All Nighwish is good but this is there greatest, and most epic. Tarja has the most amazing voice, and makes this metal in a catagory all it's own. You have just got to hear it, I can explain the way this album can make you feel. The classical of the future!	1
The first disc was defective. Returned it for replacement. The replacement is very slightly out of sync of video and audio at the end of movie. Shows poor quality control.	0
I really enjoyed this book. After getting it for free on Amazon, I had to give it a chance. It so happened that I was reading through the Bible at the EXACT location that this book takes place around. Though some of the details were obviously implied and imposed by artistic liberties, it was believable and not too far fetched or blasphemous. I would give a 5 star, but the writing was a bit elementary. It was a great read, though, and kept me interested for sure!	1
"I previewed this album, and although some of the songs are pretty off the hook, I really have to ask: What happened to this man?I remember first hearing him sing on an episode of his big sister's hit sitcom ""Moesha"" about 10 years ago, and he was terrific. Fast-forward to 2005, and I hear ""One Wish."" He whined and cried his way through the entire song.Although the songs are pretty good, his voice has just deteriorated some how. I'm not sure what happened."	0
Janet Is Truly Amazing . I Went To See Her Concert Here In Johannesburg , South Africa . It Was Unbelievable . I Bought The Vhs Tape Of The Velvet Rope And Now I Am Back To Buy The Dvd Version . I Can Watch The Tape Over And Over Again . Janet Is Truly Entertaining . I Actually Did Not Expect The Concert To Be That Great , But I Would Really Stunned . The Choreography Was Really Out Of This World . I Recommend This Movie To Everybody . For 2 Hours , You Are Transformed To A World Of Magic And Excitement . I Can Guarantee That You Will Love It . Thank You Janet For Your Outstanding Performance , It Will Honestly Remain A Part Of Me For A Very Long Time ! !	1
This is a very good rollator. Very easy to adjust, very stable, rolls easily over grass and other uneven outdoor surfaces.The adjustable height seat is great.	1
Always loved watching A Charlie Brown Christmas on TV during the holiday season, now I can watch it any time.The extra features included were great, one I had never seen before. Thoroughly enjoyable speaking as a Charlie Brown fan.	1
"If you like any special features at all do not buy this version. They are doing the same thing as Avatar. This release gets a full price but absolutely zero special features. Not so much as a trailer. They will be putting out deluxe versions toward the end of the year including a 3D combo pack, blu ray combo pack & dvd. ALL will be packed & you will kick yourself for having to buy this a second time. Many people don't care about features but if you do consider yourself forewarned. And it's not like they're giving you a cut on the price for a ""movie only"" release."	0
As a huge fan of the group, I was disappointed with this item. The interview disc is poor quality and was basically audio from existing early interviews which most fans would have already. The content is dated and is pre reunion.The book has some nice pictures which again, are all pre 'comeback'I would'nt really recommend the item to existing fans, there is'nt really any content of interest. The cover card was scraped on arrival and looked shabby despite having been well packaged.	0
Before I saw this movie I didn't expect much.It looked like another cheesy horror flick,and I have never enjoyed watching cheesy horror flicks (excepting JAWS,which I think is a triumph-did I say that out loud?) But anyway,my older brother started to rave about THE HAUNTING so I agreed to watch the copy my Mum had rented. From the word go I was hooked.The superb acting really struck me,the fear that those actors portrayed was splendid.The special effects had much to be desired,unfortunately,but the gripping storyline made my day.In fact,I was close to tears at the end when Nell and Luke died.The movie provoked so much thought and emotion in me that I had to watch it again,and when I did it was even more clear that THE HAUNTING was an exceptional film.	1
Rating **Michel Cane Frank I believe that he was a pathetic actor and he really looked like he was just doing it for money. They should have probably chosen a better person to play it. I give Michel a 3 for his acting. Julie Walters Rita I believe that she played a good role in her person and she fitted it really well. Julie I give here a 10 for her acting. Well because Frank Michel was suck a bad actor I believe that there is no two incidents that I want to discuss but instead of Frank going to Australia by him self he should of gone to Australia with Rita. So the ending really sucked. I gave the movie a 2 out of 5 because I did not really get into the movie.	0
"While this book has a wonderful visual collection of stunningly beautiful books and journals, it offers virtually no guidance on how to ""make"" them. The advice on putting together a complicated book with non-linear pages is limited to 3 steps, with no list of supplies and vague instructions. Poorly edited, there are many grammatical mistakes or typos. Buy this book for inspiration, but not for instruction."	0
"Wake me up when it's over! The only reason this movie gets two stars is for it's look and the excellent way the movie was shot. After that, it's just boring, repetitive dribble. I like the Hollywood movies better. ""Groundhog's Day"" is 15 times better than this unimaginative lump of crap."	0
"Behind the Eyes is slightly different from Amy's two previous releases; BTE is more mature and it gets better and better the more one listens to it. ""Turn This World Around"" is my favorite on the CD, but the rest of the material is also great."	1
This is a great movie. Best Batman by far. Excellent picture quality on HD DVD. Should be in everybodys collection. Period.	1
Try this album after a rough day at work. Or better yet, while you're at work. More Eno-esque than Eno himself! This collection brings together the very best elements of Eno's Ambient Music work into clear, crystaline jems of structure. Each piece has a strict internal logic. Progressions and patterns grow organically, following the rules of nature - they feel like branches and leaves growing from a stem. Primarily synthesizers and lush vocal samples combine then dissipate into silence, as indeed they must. The pieces are rhythmic, with deceptively simple, yet haunting melodies. These guys have been producing some of the best Ambient music since the mid 90s. Hard to find, but worth the effort.	1
I have thoroughly enjoyed reading Parables. I didn't expect this book to be overflowing with facts on jewish culture. Gary does an excellent job describing the context for each parable. Gary picked essential parables and truly helps you understand what Jesus meant. One nice surprise is Gary's theological application. If you like books that flow but have a deeper teaching then you should buy this book. Let this book be a deeper devotional or a study tool for your next teaching on a parable. I promise you will be inspired and encouraged by Gary's interpretation of the Parables.	1
I bought this for myself, and I really like it. The heart and key are very pretty, and as long as you keep it clean, there is a nice sparkle to it. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is because of the chain it comes with. It is very thin and easily tangles. I ended up ordering a new thicker chain for it, and now it's perfect.	1
We have been using this brand for 8 months ever since we first tried them based on price. When my son was still nursing exclusively it prevented more blowouts and now as a toddler they rarely leak. There is no better major-brand diaper for the price.	1
Le titre de ce livre ne convient tout simplement pas. En achetant ce livre, je m'attendais √† ce que le contenu soit avanc√©.

I bought this because I wanted to extend my in-home sound system to my deck. I used a pair of OSD AP-650 weatherproof speakers and I am very happy with the sound quality. The 50 watts per channel is just what I needed to get me good sound without blowing my neighbors off their decks. It all sounds great at low and full volume. Even my wife likes it.	1
Great product. Perfect rice every time. Excellent for brown rice. Keeps rice warm. Also does excellent job of cooking grits. Easy to clean. Takes a little longer to cook rice but the flavor is worth the wait. Pricey but great quality. Would highly recommend this product.	1
Interesting stories straight from the horse's mouth. Insight into a major thinker's life correcting some standard impressions of his beliefs.	1
The presentation and content of this video leaves a lot to be desired. The visual aides, diagrams, etc. are not professionally done nor are they referred to in a clear manner. The video is frankly quite boring.Search for another Lamaze video, you'll find that there is another that offers a lot more detail with a much more exciting and engaging presentation.	0
Thank you for the speedy transaction in getting this to me. We truly enjoy watching them in this video. They are truly the best.	1
thought this was a cd by the group pieces of a dream. you put it with their cds. not what i wanted.	0
Works fine on the PowerBook G4. Doesn't have an LED to tell you it's on and, of course, doesn't have a smart plug to show charging status.	1
Works great, keeps my coffee warm while I'm at my computer. Great price and great results. I would highly recommend buying this product.	1
Candide, is a satire, irony, sarcasm and hyperbole. In this novel he punctuates the naivete of optimism in a cruel, corrupt and bellicose world. In developing this theme Voltaire satirizes the philosophy of Leibniz who contended that earth is the best world possible inasmuch as it was created by a benevolent, omniscient, all-powerful God. Voltaire mercilessly ridicules Leibniz and his philosophy as simple-minded and unrealistic. Voltaire uses wit to mock the practitioners of bigotry, superstition and tyranny. This is a fairly easy read and I would recommend it.	1
". . . musically at least. Sometimes I just can't get behind a group or album that has merit because something stupid or irritating sticks out like a sore thumb. Thus I will never give Travis, Mr. Big, Mr. Mister or Uncle Kracker a chance because I don't want such stupid band names in my collection. I almost rejected Korn outright because of their lame name. Gee, might as well call your band ""Carrots"" or ""Broccholi.""SOAD can rock, no question. Some of their earlier stuff is good, well mostly the insane-sounding ""Sugar"" is great. But this album has such gratingly, embarrassingly bad lyrics I have to turn it off.""Life is a waterfall/ We drink from the river/ Then turn around and build up the wall?"" . . . ""Always wanna win but you never wanna lose?"" - DUH!!!!Sorry, this music is for pinheads."	0
We started out with Swaddlers, then moved to Baby Dry at size 2. At size 3, we switched to Huggies. No Pampers diapers have elastic on the back waist, which just asks for a poo explosion up the back. We had SEVERAL, and I finally realized my friend's diapers had elastic in the back so she didn't have this problem! She had a generic store brand even! I will never put a Pamper on my kid again because I don't want his clothes stained.	0
The TV Guide called it probably the best horror movie ever made. This was supposed to be a classic? I guess it was a classic con-job. Mia's character, or was it just Mia, was so unbelievable. The whole tale seems so, simplistic? Oh let's not go over for dinner, oh we will, oh it is so ironic Guy's suddenly taken a liking to his neighbors. The 'suggestions' and red-herrings didn't help much in alleviating the pain of a sad non-ending. I would recommend this to film buffs only. For me, at the end of two and a half hours, it felt like nothing much had happened.	0
"I am still a fan of Clay Aiken because he has a beautiful voice. However, the song selection, style of his ""made-over"" voice was disappointing. I was looking forward to hearing that smooth sexy voice of American Idol songs he sang. It was not there. Whoever decided on these songs did no justice to Clay Aiken. Maybe next time... Sorry Clay."	0
This is quite simply the worst story i have ever read in my life.It was depressing, LONG, and meandered its way aimlessly till the end. Whats worse, the book could have ended half way and still had the same impact. The character still meets the same fate, everyone would have felt the same way, and the reader would have been spared several chapters of agonizing reading had she made a different choice after confessing her secret to Angel.If you like reading a depressing story where it seems like the author is taking sadistic joy in tormenting the protagonist, this is the story for you. For everyone else, stay far far away.	0
RPM sensor was defective. The lift motor would not stop running with the new circuit board installed.I removed the new circuit board and replaced it with the old one and everything seems to be OK now.The part is so inexpensive it's not worth returning.	0
"I read this in the 1980's, and it was a non-event back then. Like most books that claim to have ""the answer,"" this book gives an enormously over-simplified view of economics that does not reflect the real world. Moreover, it presents as settled many open questions, claiming the authors opinions as facts. There are many better books on free-market economics, and far, far better books on economics in general."	0
Veteran guitarist Herb Ellis and and a somewhat newcomber guitarist Duke Roubillard showcase some fine jazz guitar interplay.Even if you're not a jazz fan, you'll appreciate this fine playing. This quintet presents three Roubillard originals with four standards.You'll hear the similarity between this album and the Great Guitar albums from past years. A fine addition to any guitar jazz lover's collection.	1
I really enjoyed this book, but the story line was a little different then I had expected it to be. This is always a fun book to read, which I will be reading in the future as well.	1
I bought this for my 4 year old daughter for her birthday. She loves rockets and I thought she would enjoy it. The pump is total junk and could not even pump enough pressure for a single flight before it broke. I spent an hour trying to fix it and the highest I've gotten the rocket to launch is a couple feet! This resulted in my daughter crying and the rocket getting thrown away. Do not buy this one!	0
My order was placed on August 28, but I have not received the printer in a month.	0
I really enjoy these DVDs. The instruction is very straight forward and easy to follow. I would absolutely recommend this for beginning hoop dancers!	1
It works like a charm. Well, it won't work over the more secure WPA encryption, but it works great with standard encryption.My complaint: It's clunky. On a computer desktop, it's alright to have something that needs to sit on the desk and connect to the PC with a USB cord. My TiVo, however sits stacked between my DVD player and my XBox. The USB WiFi adapter is forced to perch precariously on the back of the shelf. It'd be better if it was designed to just fit right into the USB port, like the one I bought for my girlfriend's computer (which cost $10 less).The TiVo is supposed to work with other brands of wireless network adapters, but I figured the safe choice was to buy the TiVo brand. Overall, I'm not disappointed.	1
Upon the third use, I started having the same problem as all the other 1-star people. The problem is with the auto input line sensing circuitry. Even with the auto-sensing switch in manual, the auto-sensing circuitry engages and disengages after every dynamic passage on a center channel home theater setup. When it engages and disengages the sound coming from the speaker connected to the amp also engages and disengages. I just ordered the Niles Audio SI-2125 to replace this piece of junk. Thanks Amazon for picking up the return shipping!	0
John Douglas sold himself out to the Ramseys. Acting as a paid consultant, he met with them and reviewed evidence and the crime scene. He criticizes colleagues and other law enforcement that believe the Ramseys are guilty. Mr Douglas did not work for the Boulder police or the D.A. so the evidence he reviewed was that which was made available by the Ramseys.If this isn't tainted, I don't know what is.The rest of the book rehashes old cases and does not offer any new information. It's a waste of time and money. Mr Douglas should be ashamed of himself for selling out.	0
I am enjoying the book. It has been a good reference for my research and for my papers.	1
Version 2.0 is a GREAT CD. It's one of those rare CD's where almost every single song is incredible. It is high energy power driving music that instantly puts me in a good mood and makes me want to thrive!	1
With Continuum being the last entry into the Stargate SG-1 story, they do a good job of tying up the one real remaining loose end, namely Ba'al. He is up to his usual tricks of trying to take over the galaxy and the SG-1 team is again tasked with saving the day. Like a lot of the episodes, SG-1 gets itself into a pretty deep pickle before finally coming through in the end, but it's a good story and certainly worth watching. But, like all of the Star Trek movies that came out after the show's finale, this movie is just a longer version of an episode that might have aired on the SciFi network during the show's run.	1
This is a pretty cool set. The only thing wrong is that is should be a little taller like in the movie. This set really recreates the tower in the movie. The only thing wrong is the door. It should be like a prison door like in the movie, not a wooden one. Some good things about this is only one of two sets that have buckbeak, one of four sets that have a dementor, and only one of two sets that have Sirus Black. I RECOMEND THAT YOU BUY THIS!!!	1
Although it doesn't get use unless we're out long enough to need a second battery, this product is working just like the original and seems to be a completely legit cannon production (despite a few other reviews).	1
"This may be my favourite Mayhem album of all. As opposed to the crude ""deathcrushing"" sound of their early stuff & the atmospheric shred of ""De Mysteriis,"" this album tends more towards technical chaotic black/death metal, really unlike anything else I've heard before. Usually very fast, sometimes atmospheric (all done w/out synths, except for the ambient intro track), and always hellish - every aspect of this music is absolutely insane, and it definitely gives hope for a grim future."	1
Some parts make no sense at all as you read through this book. In one sentence in the book Green says not to remove the fan leaves and three sentences later he says to remove them. This is very confusing and shows a lack of editing. Growing errors are littered in this book making it frustrating to read.	0
I'd like if they rode a little lower, especially since they have no fly, but overall they are quite comfortable. And sexy, I'm told :-)	1
THIS TOY IS THE BOMB!this toy has the looks, graphics,& the talents!!!even though i have not played it,i think this toy is very,very,very,cool!when i get my PET,i will go bananas!3 questions:1.how many battle chips can you use at one time?2.can you jack in to any thing?3.where can you get battle chips?THATS ALL FOLKS!	1
This cd is truly worth the wait! I can listen and enjoy each and every song in the CD.Invisible and Measure of the Man are the best!Platinum for Clay !!	1
The picture quality sub VHS standard. I'm a fan of Terence Hill films but this was by far the worst I've seen. I would not recommend this to anyone.	0
I've read few dating books from Amazon so far, but this one is just brilliant. Author will show you the most common mistakes guys do when dating with women. It really makes dating simple and fun. Thanks Corey!	1
Mary Daheim has obviously NOT had a hip replaced or she would of known that you DO need a walker and not just a wheel chair to get around after and that physical therapy starts one day after surgery. Also the obnoxious Renie sounds like a real jerk with all her screaming and whatever in a hospital. One sure can not wash their hair and take a shower after shoulder surgery either. This it the first book of the series I've read and don't know if I want to read another silly one of hers. Mary Daheim should do more research on her books and quit putting them out so fast!!!!	0
I loved this book,the recipes reminded me of family and friends I've had wonderful meals with, an still do.	1
I bought these holders for my dad because he has arthritis in his hands & it's difficult for him to hold 15-21 cards at a time. We used them over the holiday and they were a great hit.	1
Having owned and enjoyed the authors other cookbooks, getting this one was an easy decision. The good reviews helped as well.After trying a few of the recipes, I call foul.Sauces with no thickening agent were runny, dressings were bland, and main entries that were just not palatable.I'll just tweak recipes from current cookbooks to make them low carb.Oh, and on a side note, it was interesting to note that on the authors web site, this title is not even mentioned among her many other, and delightful, books.	0
To say I was disappointed in this movie would be an understatement. To classify this as a horror film would be just plain wrong. While it achieves its goal to tell a good story, the chills and thrills just aren't there. I cannot recommend this movie to anyone with a serious yen to be scared out of their wits. If you want a real frightening tale, I recomend Rose Red. That's how a haunted house story should be told.	0
Well-acted for the most part, it was a relief to turn this movie off. The tension and psychosis which built but never held interest, created empathy, or suspended self, finally erupted into a confusing condonning of rape. This is one of those ugly movies that defiles the consciousness of its viewers with no higher purpose - artistic or philosophic. Your time would be better spent watching lint form in the dryer.	0
This product is a great space saver and easy to put together. I keep the rack in the garage by my car and grab shoes off it on the way to work and other places. The rack is smaller than I thought which is good. It does not take up much space and allows me to keep lots of shoes on the same rack. It's very sturdy so there is no worry about it tipping over or shoes falling off.	1
"A book that I would recommend to anyone wondering what they aredreaming about. I had quite a few ""ahaa"" moments while reading this book. Well written and lots of example dreams to help youdecipher your own. Thank you to Sylvia."	1
I like these diapers, they're easy to put on a squirming baby. I like that the swaddlers have a wet indicator, but those aren't available for Amazon Prime, so I went with these. No real complaints, I can usually tell when my baby needs a change without a wet indicator.	1
"This film is utterly horrible. Gore shoots from the creatures and women as if propelled from a pressure washer, the creatures somehow rip several of the women to shreds without their teeth coming into contact with flesh, their movements look ridiculous as they are not actually moving more quickly but the film rate is, the ""monsters"" are on camera far too much and end up looking silly rather than scary, a woman accidentally kills a companion in the heat of battle and is judged, crippled and left for dead by another of the group, a dream/gotcha ending, and a nonexistent plot.I am a fan or horror movies, but this one is just not good. It starts off with a compelling story and then ends up being a slasher flick with characters so annoying, protagonist included, that you cannot wait for them to die. Although a lot of time and money was spent on special effects, it is not a redeeming factor. As an obscure military leadership saying goes, ""You can't polish a turd."""	0
I would like to recommend to anyone who have thought of buying this box set, to stay away. I've been a die-hard Metallica fan since the 80's, and i have never bought a bootleg album w/out hearing something off of it. I'm also in the Official Metallica Club, we are notified weeks before anyone else that a new album is coming out. They never mensioned this one, so then again i'd advise you to stay away from this item. The Garage Inc. CD is great. I've got all the versions of it except this one. I of course don't plan on getting it though. Who in their right mind would pay almost $140 for an item not even licensed by the band. I hope everyone who was thinking about buying this reads this first, so you all don't get ripped off.	0
This mug warmer DOES NOT KEEP LIQUID HOT. I purchased this one to replace my old mug warmer that kept coffee at a perfect temperature. This mug warmer barely keeps the coffee lukewarm. Don't waste your time or your money on this product.	0
This game is so awesome, I got this game on Christmas Day and once I the plastic off, I grabbed my GBA and put it in. There are a huge variety of game modes in this game. Although this game only has 15 characters, this game is very attractive. The characters are very recognizable. And unlike the first Road to Wrestlemania, each character has a unique moveset. For example: The Rock has his Layin' the SmackDown Punch Rush, Undertaker has the Chokeslam and the Tombstone, Triple H has his Jumping Knee Attack, Chin Crusher, and his Spinebuster. The championship mode on this game is fun, although no storylines. You can win merchandise from ShopZone by by doing special tasks. You can create a PPV, but you must make the events enjoyable not only to the fans, but...Vince McMahon! Overall, this game is a great game, I recommend this to any Pro Wrestling fan. It is a fun and enjoyable game.	1
Got these for Christmas from my wife. They looked great but it's February and the crotch is already completely torn out of them. Just turning over in bed is more than the material can handle. I do NOT recommend these.	0
It's great. it is heavy snow outside, but the diaper arrived on time. very thing is good.thank you for your service and product.	1
While I can appreciate Bradbury's views on television's effects on people, I believe he gave far too much credence to the communistic approach to controlling people by doing away with books. Considering the beautiful complexity of a book like Dandelion Wine, this was disappointingly simplistic and unrealistic. And as to the war and the 'bomb' at the end, he stepped totally out of reality, since by the time this was written, the world would have known that the effects of radiation went far beyond the initial destruction. And he gave no explanation as to why there should have been a war at all. Bradbury ignored these issues to the detriment of his entire concept.	0
I love this CD my fav song is Special it is the best song!!!! I cant believe the price either on Amazon it is so chesp if your gonna bye this CD bye it here!!!!	1
Her antics is not very entertaining and very annoying to watch. I borrowed this dvd from the library and glad I didn't invest money but unfortunately my time. The only time i can tolerate the video is when she was actually serious and informative about childbirth.	0
"Listen up and watch that video for ""Invisible"" to see what pre-fab crapola Clay Aiken is up to. Remember when U2 had a spontaneous street concert and were shut down by the police? Well, Aiken's video for ""Invisible"" wants to convince us that his song ""Invisible,"" which isn't about much, has such political relevance and cachet that the police and a HELICOPTER have to suddenly rush in and hold the fans at bay. It's all calculated, guaranteed to provide his voice -- which deserves better -- to seem dangerous, although that danger has been carefully accounted for. Oh, Clay's not dangerous, except to ask people to open up their wallets for a song that is designed by a hit factory and make it SEEM politically relevent. Thanks a lot, Clay. If you were invisible -- oh wait, you already are."	0
I got this player for Christmas and it immediately had bad screen problems, the LCD screen would freeze or make thick dark lines. The rewind bar doesn't work either! you can rewind it and the seek bar will show it rewinding, but it'll resume right where it left off! I only give this player 2stars just because it's ease.	0
I don't know why they called this movie Batman. Maybe it should have been called Ninja man. This is not any Batman I know or would want to know. The plot and character development of this film are sorely lacking even for a comic based character- as it relies entirely on non- stop action. I enjoyed action films when Arnold was the big star of the time, but Batman Begins lacks any real excitement and is incredibly over-serious and lacking in humour.Christian Bale lacks any personality as Batman. Michael Keaton was infinitely superior. Bale has no sense of humour, is anything but handsome or physically imposing and someone who is certainly not suited for any leading role other than American Psycho.	0
I used this product over the weekend and having problems with my eyes it was hard to read the back label. The company not including that normal one page instruction made it very difficult for me. In that case, I could have purchased similar item at Walmart and it would have been cheaper for me to return it if I was not satisfied. I would have sent this item back. However,shipping cost was too much.	0
"Constantine was a big disappointment to me. Unlike many other reviewers, I had never seen this in print. Reeves does a fair job in his role, but Rachel Weisz fails to deliver here. Her character is unconvincing and ""wooden"". The story is a remix of story lines from other stories, and it fails to bring much that is fresh to the screen. The theology is strange, Satan looks like a retired guy from Florida, and the ""balance between good and evil"" rule seems contrived.The story was not compelling. I almost turned it off out of boredom."	0
"Of course purists will always cry foul at the ""messes"", ""disasters"" and ""heresies"" Hollywood performs on their little ""possesions"". Since I did not carry this burden, I was able to enjoy Constantine on its own, no preconceptions or rules. This movie rocks, plain and simple, and all of the ignoramus who insist on the ""adaptation"" label will surely fail to judge it on its own right.I am not a comic book fan, and I did not read any of the ""HELLBALZER"" (as a so-called fan of the comic books mistakenly typed, TWICE). I enjoyed ""Constantine"". And as for those who also did, kudos. Don't let the comic book crowd make you feel any less. After all, their limitations and views are theirs alone to suffer..."	1
Although this book was very well written, I couldn't understand it very well. I probably would not have finished it if it hadn't been required reading for school. I would think that older kids might be able to undertsand it, but that most of it is too subtle for eighth graders.	0
This thing has about 3 poems in it. Terrible! Do NOT waste your time!!!!!!! Extra words extra words extra words	0
For a long time i've been waiting for this dvd, it becames my way of life, i bought a CB750 and a F-100 V8. These kind of vehicles really amaze me.	1
I greatly enjoyed this audio book, partly because the narrator's vocal gifts brought alive the various characters and thier accents. I also enjoyed revisitng a book that I had read long ago, in the earlry years of my life. I now was able to see more clearly the fears inspired by the Communist party in post-war Eastern Europe and China, and how those events inspired Orwell's writing of this book and the reactions of his audience.	1
"This album was originally relased on Virgin records about 1976 and it was playing all over London for about a year. Delroy was working as Bob Marley's road manager at the time. The backing band ISUS consisted of the solid drum and bass from what later became ASWAD. First time I ever went into a studio in London - I was 16 and it was with Delroy who was recording with The Cimmarons a song called ""Walking Down Lonely Street"" :o) - that was 30 years ago! Anyway - I just ordered this and it's worth it for the first track alone called ""Jah Wonderful"" - a tune that stuck in my head to this day. Delroy! Those were the days!"	1
"I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"	0
"The ball that had arrived is not the ball that is pictured in the description. It's not even a GoFit brand ball. The product description is not just misleading it's a lie. The ""ball"" isn't even round. It's an oblate spheroid and you can see the drip marks of rubber under a 100W equivalent compact fluorescent light 5+ feet away from the light source. The ball has dark black smudge marks/stains on it. It doesn't look anything like the picture that is used for the item. I will be attempt to get a full refund! This is the actual ball that you will be receiving!gpct203 red is the model that is on the box that this ball came in. The site below shows the same ball with those textured stripes going around it.[...]"	0
We purchased the HD Tivo DVR, which requires only this adapter to get the internet wirelessly. It sits next to my PS3, yet gets worse reception than it, and even my iPod's reception, only 2 rooms away from the wireless modem. Watching HD movies streaming from Netflix is nearly impossible, it pauses about every 3-4 minutes for about 7-10 seconds, completely losing you from the storyline of the movie. In order to come up with a different solution for better reception, we may have to scrap the antenna all together, wasting the $40 we just spent on it.	0
We took this tent to the beach to camp for the weekend. After taking it out of the box (brand new) and getting the supports hammered in, the corner snapped completely off (cheap sewing job). Then we tried rigging it in place and that helped but the wind (10mph at most) kept imploding the tent and snapping more fabric in the process.Another important note is the window and door zippers get caught into the mesh and rip...we payed 100+ dollars for this tent and we want every penny of it back.Overall, do not buy this tent unless you're planning on putting it in the backyard for your kids. It just doesn't hold up. I would have given it zero stars but one will have to do.	0
I have not read the book as of yet, but just wanted to let people know how substantial this book really is. It is about the size and weight of a large dictionary. While not the best for portability, it is definitely a keepsake or collector type of book. It even has it's own ribbon style bookmark built in. Can't wait to read it.	1
I agree that this is a valuable addition to the small library of books for working mothers. But a heads up-- this is more of a bound packet than a book. It has a photocopied-type cover and looks like it was printed on a standard laser printer with double spaced Times New Roman font. Publishers-- someone work with the author to get a shiny new updated version please!	1
It's no Spiderman.But Christopher Nolan finally got the feeling of a Batman movie right. And Christian Bale was very good as Bruce Wayne. We didn't get to see much of Batman after all.But the movie was too predictable and the storyline boring, and just a little too star-studded which came off as pompous. I can only imagine where all these 5-star reviews are coming from: the 15 - 23 age group.It was not a great movie. The evil bad guy was obvious since they wouldn't knock out a big star from the plot like that so early. Katie Holmes was so boring and lackluster as the girlfriend, truly whiny and dull. She's no Kirsten Dunst in Spiderman that's for sure.	0
"Apparently a replacement for the terrific 932c printer, this ""upgraded"" model is a bomb. Jams, can't print straight, picks up multiple sheets, and horrible service all add up to a misfire. I went through the hassle of getting two replacement units shipped to me, and both replacements had more problems than the original! I've written off my 940c. I don't think anyone should waste their time (and certainly not their money) on this one."	0
"This book is for older women who need to ""find themselves"" all over again and use as a tool to journal thier thoughts. As a woman in her 20's I still found it to be most helpfull in conjunction with my regualar Franklyn and Palm pilot as a way to organize my thoughts and goals through journal writting. It's a great gift for a woman of any age!"	1
This diaper is the cheapest brand name diapers I can find when you buy them in bulk and use Amazon's subscription program. It works great for my now 6 month old. He started out with swaddlers when he was a newborn. I switched to baby-dry when he turned 3 month. This diaper barely leaks. Only time it leaked was when he slept too long and I forgot to change him when he got fed once. It was over 12hrs, so I'm sure no other diaper could do any better.Some might not agree this is not the cheapest, but when I was searching for new diaper, this Economy pack for subscription price was the cheapest (per diaper price). I even compared with other brands and from stores like Sam's club. It is really convenient to use subscription service for diaper. I don't have to go to the store, and if I don't need one on certain month, I can just skip that month's shippment.	1
"not Clay Aiken. I am so sick of all of these people saying Clay Aiken is the ""Real American Idol"". If I remember correctly, HE LOST. Did you hear that people? HE LOST to Ruben Studdard by over 100,000 votes. I personally like Clay, I think he is extremely talented, and seems to be a genuinely nice guy. However, this album is just horrible. It's slow, bland, and just boring. All the songs sound the same, and the lyrics to ""Invisible"" are just a bit disturbing. I hope on his next outing he will have better material, he deserves better than this stuff. If you want to hear American Idol at it's best, go pick up ""Free Yourself"" by Fantasia. She's the best idol of all of them."	0
When you first get these, you will realize that they are WAY BIGGER than they should be & assume they have made a mistake. But then, when you wash them, they will shrink into TINY kids looking clothes. I washed these in cold water, did not put in dryer, yet they shrunk about 4 to 5 sizes. I also washed in a gentle cycle, yet the seams look they are starting to fall apart and lint sticks all over them & they come out of the machine FULL OF WRINKLES..so basically after the first wash they are garbage...so unless you plan on having your PJ's dry cleaned, I wouldn't waste my money on these, they were cozy & comfortable at first (although when they arrive they will be WAY TO BIG) but once they make contact with water they are ruined (even though it says they can be machine washed & dried) I can't imagine if I had put them in the dryer, they would probably turn into doll clothes, save your money & buy the cheaper satin version, at leat they don't get ruined in the wash.	0
I got this dress in red just three weeks ago to wear it at a christmas party and I got so many compliments on it. The dress is just gorgeous and the price is incredibly low. Very good quality and it fits perfectly. I ordered a size medium and it was just perfect. I took it out of the package, tried it on and fell in love with it. The red color is just stunning. I ordered it on a sunday night and it came in the mail on wednesday. Very fast delivery. I definitely recommend this dress.	1
John Carter of Mars was one of my favorite all time heroes, ranking right up there with Conan, Elric of Melnibone, and of course Tarzan. I read it as a teenager, and recently read it again, and was again amazed by the story. Of course Burroughs didn't believe in that Mars anymore than anyone else. It was nonetheless great Romantic Science Fantasy. Red Martians,Green Martians, four armed carnivorous apes and of course Thoats, flying battleships, rifle that kill at a hundred miles, and of course sword fights. Complete nonsense if looked at rationally, but still a great story. Burroughs was criticized for too many outrageous coincidences in his stories, but that is the stuff of exciting literature. Recommend that this book be on everyone's reading list before seeing the movie.	1
"Maybe not as good as ""Black Celebration,"" but still a great album. ""Never Let Me Down Again"" is a classic. ""Strangelove,"" ""Pimpf,"" and ""Behind the Wheel"" are also good tracks. ""The Things You Said"" and ""Little 15"" are kinda brooding but in that unmistakable way that makes Depeche Mode as good as they are. Just another really good album."	1
I too have the same problem most recent reviewers have had: when I plug the charger in, it cycles between charging and not charging every two seconds. The computer doesn't end up charging.In addition, the version I have doesn't look like the picture on the Amazon web site, and doesn't have the power LED.Clearly there is an epidemic of defective chargers. And we, the customer, have to go to the hassle of obtaining a return authorization and sending it back.I notified the seller. I am also going to notify Amazon to research this topic, and take the product off the site until they can resolve the issue. Other than this charger, my experience with Amazon has been exemplary.I strongly suggest that if you too have bought one of these chargers and have had trouble with it, please post here.	0
"Almost a full hour into this movie before you see what the movie is even supposed to be about. It's basically a chick flick with mutants in it for the last 25 minutes or so. A Horror movie? Suspense? Right. I guess this is the new style of ""horror"" I'll stick with Halloween, The Exorcist and Texas Chainsaw Massacre.Basically, 6 young women go to the mountains and romp around together trying to help their one friend through the loss of her family, this consists of the first 50 some minutes of the movie. THEN they FINALLY go to this cave and after another 15 minutes you see what's chasing them and wanting to kill them.. The mutants are actually pretty neat but you don't see much of them as this is more like ""Sweet Home Alabama meets The Gargoyles"". If your going to advertise a movie as ""scary"" and ""horror"" than MAKE IT LIKE ONE. This is just a chick flick with some ""BOO!s"" tossed in towards the end, stay away from this failed flick."	0
I purchased this DVD with much enthusiasm only to find that it dose not play on my combo bluray/HD player.I send it back for replacement and it still would not play and had to finally return it all together.It seem from reading other reviews this is typical of this title (or series). Don't waste your time buying this DVD.	0
Well, this was a perfect ending to a long busy day. I ordered the movie under the Tucson Sun to sit back and relax. It was very very enjoyable. I'm saying all this in a long-winded way because this review requires I write 20 words. This is actually kind of a pain because I am turned off about writing anything about these. But it was a fine purchase.	1
This was pretty good stuff. I didn't agree with everything, but it did cause me to think about some things.	1
This device does well enough keeping the coffee warm, but I have black gunk along the bottom of every cup and mug that has sat on the warming pad, which seems to come off only with a long soaking in CLR.	0
i have always been a fan of romantic comedies, and i've even been able to enjoy formulaic ones such as the wedding planner and it could happen to you, but this movie is just too awful. the acting is atrocious and cher is just way too old for the part (is she supposed to look fifty?). personally i love nicholas cage but there is nothing appealing about his character in this movie and the thick black hair all over his body certainly doesn't help.none of this would have annoyed me greatly had the lines in this movie not been so hokey and badly delivered. i think i laughed, at most, twice, which is sad since i am easily amused if the lines are halfway witty. if you rent this movie you probably won't die from sheer mortification that such a bad movie could be made, but Moonstruck is certainly not a good enough movie to buy!	0
"I am mad at myself for wasting ten bucks on this book! The plot was slower than a turtle swimming in a pool full of yogurt. The characters were boring and I never felt any connection to any of them. The zombies were equally as boring. I grew weary of the snarky way the characters were in the beginning, when they were all still in the one depressing building together. I expected things to pick up after Emma, Mike and Carl struck out on their own but that didn't happen either.One of the best series I've read (zombie themed) was the ""As the World Dies"" trilogy by RhiannonFrater. Those books were fast paced, full of action and intrigue and the characters were interesting. Plus it also made you think about how mankind really WOULD react if some similar apocalypse occurred. I CARED about the characters in that story and immediately downloaded the second and third books in this series after reading the first. I WON'T be doing that with the ""Autumn"" series."	0
I was disappointed in this movie. From the description, I thought it would be more comprehensive regarding Beau Brummell's rise to popularity in Regency England. It was more 'artistic'. I would not recommend.	0
The lady is kinda annoying. But the videos made me feel prepared and made me feel comfortable with my decision to not go to any formal classes, these were more than enough.	1
I have to say that I have been a little less enthused about music in the past 5 years. However, for the first time in years I am just blown away by the EXTREME talent of Clay Aiken. I have never heard anything quite so beautiful, than his voice, in all of my life. I love EVERY song on this CD. I got this CD when it first came out and I can not stop listening to it. From the second I get in my car until I get out, that CD is blasting in my car!! The enthusiasm that I have for this talented man's music is indescribable. I feel like a teenager again because his music makes me scream with absolute joy. I would recommend this CD to anyone and everyone because the intensity and electricity that exudes from his voice is miraculous!!	1
"Forgive me for rating a respected book so poorly. If your quest is to discover why certain disciplines are needed, then ignore what I have to say. This book delivers. If, on the otherhand, you are going to buy this book with the expectation that it will move beyond expressing the need, you will be disapointed. If you are looking for help in developing these disciplines in your life, you will not find it here. This book is not about ""how"", only ""why"". Which question are you asking?"	0
I have this book. While I have not taken the ASVAB, what I've seen of the samples in the book would indicate that criticism about incorrect answers is false. And I'm a pretty good test-taker.Wiley has elevated their Dummies books by making their contents as accurate as possible. That is why Dummies books are used as classroom resources across the country and why I also use them when I need to get up to speed quickly, accurately and without unnecessary information.	1
"Each to his own taste, but I wish I'd read some of the negative reviews here before I wasted time and money on this book. The only ""secret"" revealed in this book is the author's personal, overt political pro abortion and gay marriage agenda. Seriously, if you are a Christian, do yourself a favor and just skip this ridiculous attempt to make fun of your Christian beliefs."	0
It is a good book for review and modivation. Technique is well explained. Makes a great read for beginner and intermediate fly fisherman.	1
This video, like many before it, have prefered to depict the activity as quiet, restful, and meditative. This video is useful to teach beginners to classic ski provided you have an instructor doing the narration; otherwise you may just put the class to sleep.Today the consumer has MTV... Warren Miller (Alpine), Christian Begin (Mountain Biking) and xczone (Cross-country) films-videos to choose from.I found Cross Country Skiing by Jeff Nowak in the library. Compare with some modern titles... you be the judge.	0

If you have ever had an iPod you will kick yourself for buying this player. Replaced my iPod Nano because the battery life was fading. Unfortunately, there is no way to get the advertised 35 hours of advertised battery life. You should expect 6 to 8 hours.It is crashy. It occationally corrupts the tracks when it crashes. The screen is average. Getting podcsts to show up as podcasts has been frustrating. Forget about video podcasts. You will be spending a significant amount of time formatting them. Of course, you should expect even worse battery life.The reason the iPod Nano is $130; it works!	0
"I bought this for my grandson who loves ""cheesy"" movies but even he said this movie was too stupid. The first Killer Tomatoes movie at least had some funny parts. This movie doesn't. Don't waste your money."	0

I eagerly awaited the release of this album, but was quite disappointed when I heard it. Other than This is the Night, the remaining songs are very plain and quite forgettable, and you will have a difficult time not skipping ahead to the next song in hopes of something better. I can't help but feel that the album was rushed to market, and that in doing so, good song choices were not made. The songs simply do not showcase Clay's singing ability and range, and many of their lyrics and melodies leave a lot to be desired. I wish I could have written a wonderful review, but unless your an absolute Clay diehard fanatic, I think that you will be disappointed with this album.	0
This CD is amazing. Lhasa and her band demonstrate top musicianship combined with abundant passion. If you are a music fan with a large collection and taste of music, you must add this CD to your collection. It will be among your top 10 favorites. And that goes for music fans with modest CD collections too! And if you get a chance to see them perform live they are even better. I saw her last year in Montreal. Wow!	1
Maybe my husband is bigger than normal but we had the hardest time getting this on. Once it was on we wanted it off pretty quick. The vibrations weren't very strong and one of the vibes was stuck in the on position so we had to remove batteries to turn it off. I didn't get any benefit from it and I don't think he got much.	0
"The CD will not grab you at first, its not as catchy as Lagwagon's previous releases, but with a few listens it makes the argument for greatest Lag album ever. The flow through out the whole thing is perfect. The CD is dedicated to Derrick (the bands original drummer) and with that comes a lot of emotion, dealing a lot with reflection, moving on, and self-discovery, the lyrics here are very well crafted. I absolutly cannot stop listening to this record. It's got so much to offer. The highlights of the album for me ""Runs in the Family"", ""The Controtionist"" and ""Days of New"", which will most likley give you the chills if youre a die hard lagwagon fan.I truly belive that Joey Cape is one on the most incedible song writers of the past couple decades. Listen to Lagwagon along with his side project Bad Astronaut and you have the makings of a musical genious. Cant wait for the upcoming tour! Keep making music guys!"	1
My step-daughter got a set of glasses, and 3 family members cut themselves because they broke as they were washing them. I thought I'd replace her [poorly made] and dangerous ones with these, due to what I thought of as the quality name brand Anchor Hocking. She already got a different set of glasses, so I kept them for myself. One was broken in the box when I opened them up. I thought no big deal. I started using them, and within a month, of the 16 total, I am down to only one large one and four small ones. I also have 2 less butterfly stitches and 6 less bandaids in my cabinet. My daughter informed me that these were the EXACT glasses she experienced the same problems with. I am sorry to discover that Anchor Hocking is no longer going to be associated with quality, as it used to be in the past.	0
the sound of this record is very particular, may be a little precarius, but you can see right there the talent and the sign of the band.this album is very enjoyable!	1
I rented this movie while my husband was out of town, looking forward to a good chick flick. By the middle of my movie, I couldn't believe I was still sitting there, and by the end, I wanted my $4.00 back from Blockbuster. The story did not keep my attention and the pregnant friend has got to be the worst actress ever. I do not recommend this at all!	0
I'm glad I read this book. It was a fascinating read on the complexities of strict government control. But the story is really more than about government, and it's strict control over the populace. It's about the psychology of humans and living in a society with limited personal freedoms.What I struggled with was the persistent inner-monologue. This book is written like most 20th century literature and is loaded with the protagonist basically thinking/talking to himself for long periods of time, which, to me, can be quite boring and hard to read.Maybe it's because my generation and I'm not used to such writing styles. Most movies and books these days have more action, more conversation and less inner-monologue. Good or bad, that's the way it is.Otherwise, this lived up to hype and icon status that it is known for.	1
"Merry Christmas and all that!! I have decided to PAY IT FORWARD!!! and give everyone I know ""Measure of a Man"" for the hoildays. What better way to pass on the joy of listening to and becoming emmersed in the awesome sound of Clay Aiken!!!! I feel it is one small thing I can do for mankind--- I suggest we all do the same!!! Happy Listening!!!"	1

"At first this printer worked well, but after a year it is nothing but trouble.To begin with, you can't print more than 4-5 pages before the ""page grabber"" will start to grab more than one sheet of paper at a time, and the text ends up going across both of them.Then there is the printer driver, which is also not up to par -- where is the manual two sided printing that has been in the classic Mac OS for all of these years?In short, this was my last HP printer. The jamming paper feed is too much for me to handle."	0
I'm reviewing all three Albums together as they are by the same artist; Regina Carter. Again I purchased these Albums on the basis of a 30 sec listen. They all lived up to my expectations. If anyone is familiar with Stephane Grapelli, Regina Carter's style is very similar. She really swings. I love these albums and play them over and over again.	1

I purchased this because of the good reviews.. but I didn't have a good experience. Putting the card in was easy enough... but once I got it in, the signal was 14% ... so I thought... ok.. we are 2 floors away... maybe it's not close enough. So I moved it to the room 10 feet away from the wireless router.. and I still only got 14% and it kept dropping connection. I messed with the settings for several hours and couldn't get any better connection. Uninstalled, returned to Amazon at their expense for a prompt refund.. and purchase the WRT54G. I get over 80% with that!	0
A cute, romantic comedy. Great scenes of Manhattan and Brooklyn. Very good character development, and Cher and Nicolas Cage work very well together. Olympia Dukakis does a great job as an emotionally deep, morally strong mother with a sense of humour. Great music too, though the 5.1 mix was not very dynamic. Sound stays mainly in the center channel, which itself was muddy, making dialogue difficult to follow at times. The video was pan and scan, which ruins it in my book.	0
"This again is Mattel proving to me that someone is not playing with the toys after they are made. Horrible construction, directions are a nightmare (no words at all and very hard to follow) and they put the flimsy paper piece on the bottom and the ""cave"" components on the top. This not only makes no sense (don't they know batman went down into the cave to get to the computers and all) but it makes the product very top heavy. They actually recommend you glue it to your walls. No toy should be sold that is 42 inches tall and have to be glued to the walls!! All they have to do at Mattel is hire someone with a young child or let a child play with a set and they would have seen it could have been switched around (heavy stuff on bottom) and it would work better. As my kid would say ""DUH"""	0
Keeps food warm. Sticks to the tray of the high chair. Gerber bowl doesn't stick. The little dividers are nice for serving. The only complaint is that it is very difficult to get the divided bowl off the bottom.	1
As a California resident who feared the loss of access to Foie Gras mandated in July, I stocked up on Rougie Duck Foie Gras. It is not as good as the product we purchased in Paris and brought back with us in January, but it was all I could find that was affordable. Store in Refrigerator and note the long shelf life. Very tasty.	1
This trilley has been opersted only a few hours and the drive system seems to be slipping already. Not durable and not recommended.	0
We, for me, was not a good read. Perhaps if I was a mathematician and not have read the other dystopia books, Brave New World and 1984, it would have been a fun book to read as other reviewers have stated. Perhaps this was a serious book, but it was not an entertaining book to read. The book was a can.	0
And when I say cheap, I mean 'low quality'. Ordered this and was surprised to find that it's nothing more than a cheap, low-grade bicycle helmet- something you might pay $29 for at Wal-Mart. My old $49 Trek biking helmet is much better quality.What else?-It didn't fit well.-My bike helmet has a one-handed adjustment for size... this doesn't. That small detail makes a difference if you're wearing a cap or not in changing weather conditions.-The chin-strap buckle is small and flimsy.Pulled it out of the box, looked at it, tried it on and packed it up to send right back.	0
I bought this book after buying Adorable Knits for Tiny Tots and knitting several items from that book. From this one I have made the teddy, the cloud pillow and am about 70% of the way through the kaleidoscope blanket (I decided that knitting 49 squares was too much like hard work and so adapted the pattern to be knit all in one go on a circular needle- its going well but maybe the squares would have been easier!). My knitting friend has also made the dolly with fabulous results. With the exception of the cloud pillow I have substituted local yarns with no problems. the only problem I have had was with yarn quantities- The cloud pillow called for six balls of expensive Rowan yarn, which was more that enough for two pillows. I plan to knit the star and moon blanket and the kitty cat jumper next. This is a lovely book with plenty of fabulous patterns.	1

It was an accident that I chanced upon watching The Odyssey on the Hallmark Network. No viewing time not well-spent with the lavish production design, brilliant acting, and not-off-tangent-from-literature screenplay. I hope they release a DVD version right away.	1
I LOVE THIS CD. A VERY REFRESHING AND UNIQUE SOUND FROM THE NEWEST SUPERSTAR IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY!	1
I've only worn this for a day so far, but I love it! I still have a little bit of a tummy from the birth of my son 8 months ago. This really holds you in, its comfortable and I don't think it shows through your clothes! I highly recommend!!	1
This is one CD that I can listen over and over again and still get chills. CLAY Aiken Has a God given Gift He is amazingly talented and very Sexy. For the Person who was negative about Him just to boost Taylor Hicks and His CD there is no need to bash the True American Idol Clay Aiken just to get Your point for Taylor accross. I too Love Taylor I was part of the soul patrol and I do have Under the Radar and while it's ok it pales in any comparison to any of Clays CD's. Buy Measure of A Man and any CD Clay records You won't be sorry. He is amazing.	1
I love this movie, it is a great movie, a lot of people think this is a stupid movie, but I think it is a classic, and is VERY well done, I think everyone should own this movie, or at least watch it!!!	1
George Orwell is a master of the English language, his superb style of writing and the intensity of the story is sustained throughout.The novel covers a timeless issue. Orwell attempts to shock us with the extremities that exist in a totalitarian society whose ultimate purpose is to obtain power. Perhaps these issues, as mentioned in the afterthought, are relevant in areas apart from totalitarianism. Perhaps capitalism is also a class distinction where money is representative of power.These and other issues are covered, proving Orwell's brilliant writing genius.	1
I own one of the Jawbone torture devices. I had an old Jabra with the mini ear gels and just for giggles swapped out the hard plastic stock Jawbone things with them. It was an amazing difference. The Minis fit very well and direct the sound into your ear channel. Sometimes they do fall off so you have to be very careful with them.Unfortunately these eargels reviewed here are not them. You want these: EarGels (MiniGels) for Jabra BT250, BT250v, BT500, BT2020, C220s, C250, GN6210 are not them. They are only available from Jabra [...]	0

The bold faced comments by Laura Ross are frustrating. Who cares what she thinks? It would have been much more appropriate and an easier read without them. The thoughts are not sensitive to the original - seems lick a gemick.Not happy with the book.	0
We purchased this as a gift for a seven year old grandson. His mother reports that it has helped to positively channel the interactions between him and his two older brothers while traveling in their minivan.	1
I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in.	1
I'm a white female who is married to a black man. I'm outraged that she does not agree with interracial marriages. She talks about living in AmeriKKA, but it is her as well who promotes racist views. How are we to live as a nation if people can't be friends/lovers just because of their colour. Obviously we haven't progressed as a nation if we can't accomplish that.	0
Awesome book. Changed my running style forever. Not a run goes by where I do not think about the techniques in this book.	1
Utterly amazing and unique sound. Her voice is so powerful.	0
When i received the movie, it wouldnt play in any of the dvd players that we have in the house,,i think the movie was a fake!!!!	0
"roman polanski firmly established himself among american audiences when he took ira levins fine potboiler into a different stratum. of course the movie has taken on an eerily prescient nature what with the events of polanskis life shortly afterwards (and id love to see it with its bookmark, the 1971 ""macbeth"" -- sadly not on dvd). but this was the best (maybe the ONLY good) performance mia farrow ever gave, and theres a ton of great supporting work, most notably by ruth gordon who turned this oscar winning role into a late career surge. thankfully censorious rules restrained what a few years later might well have given way to excesses. this movie captures 1968 new york city in a manner few others do."	1
"Your inventory of Futuro Knee braces is bad and is being investigated by one of your Customer Service persons. I speak with confidence because I have worn the same brand, style, and size brace for years. The first shipment of 2 braces consisted of one correct package but the other was a ""small"" size clearly marked [package and product lable] as ""medium"". When the exchange shipment arrived, both packages contained ""small"" size braces but the lables and packages were clearly marked ""medium"".Both shipments have been returned in the last few days. In my mind this is obviously a manufacturers problem. To this day Amazon has been trying to resolve this issue. I am waiting for instructions on how to obtain the proper items."	0

Francis just got divorced from her husband, and is depressed. Her best friend realizes this and because of her pregnancy cannot go with her lover on a romantic tour of Tuscany, so they offer her the tickets for the trip instead.At first Francis does not want to go to Italy, but eventually decides to go. She soon finds that Tuscany is just what she needed and sees a house that she then buys to her friend's astonishment.With a bunch of friends including a former model, a bunch of Polish construction workers Francis asked to fix the house, and a neighbor she starts to heal. It also doesn't hurt that while she was in Rome she met a man that does not turn out to be Mr. Right, but turns out being good for her self-esteem.A very good movie about starting over	1
I have not seen this movie since I was a young teenager and have been looking for it for so long. I was so excited when I found it on Amazon, I bought it straight away. On recieving, I cleared my afternoon, took the phone of the hook so not to be disurbed, sat down and enjoyed every minute of it. It's not Academy Award stuff, just a lovely romantic romp,something to get lost in for an hour and a half. Victor Mature may not have been one of the greatest actors, but I do enjoy anything he's in, there is just something about him and I thank god he graced the silver screen with his presence. Do yourself a favour, and just enjoy.	1
Within 24 hours of using this product there is already a huge difference in my skin. I love it! It's light, it smells great, and it really does what it claims to do.	1
Before I decided to get this player, I did my research. I looked up the ipod, the dell jukebox, and the samsung napster player. I chose this one because from what I read, it was the best deal for the money. Another reason I got it is because you can put WMA files on it. That takes up half the space of MP3's. That's important because I have a lot of music. The software is great. you can sort your music by artist, title, album, or genre, and you can play music based on those categories. transfering is easy, the software makes everythig pretty easy. even the battery life is great- it advertises 14 hours, it's actually a little less but still good. only 1 problem, no accessories...yet. I hope it's because it's new and they are not out yet, but being without a remote is hard. They player's interface itself is also very easy to use. can't complain and I recommend it over all the other players, just hope that remote will come out soon. GET IT, IT'S WOTH EVERY PENNY!!	1

"I saw this movie in the theater when it came out. For the first time in my life, I was part of a theater full of people who began screaming comments at the screen as the movie went on, Mystery Science Theater 3000 style, with not one patron becoming upset.That's how bad this POS is. I did enjoy it, because some of the people in the crowd were really funny and it made this awful waste of time palateable. To this day, my friends and I use ""Constantine"" as a punch line.Run, screaming from this ""film."""	0
I have not read any of Charlie Smith's other work, so I can't compare this to previous efforts. His writing is poetic, and truly impressive in short bursts. But over the long haul, the poetry interferes with the prose. Words and phrases seem to be chosen more for their sounds and rhythms than for their contributions to plot, and dialogue can be stilted. Imagery is vivid but occasionally self-indulgent. The storyline is interesting at first but eventually grows gaudy and distasteful. The power of Smith's language is his greatest strength, but it is a strength better suited to poetry than novels.	0
I had very bad hoarseness from acid reflux. Prescription medicine wasn't helping. My doctor advised elevating the head of the bed with blocks but that was not practical. I showed my doctor a picture of the prop up pillow and he said it looked to be the correct dimension. Within a couple of days after receiving my pillow my hoarseness was gone! Yes, the pillow appears expensive but it is much less expensive than buying an adjustable bed. I don't use the neck roll - I prefer to use my own memory foam pillow. My doctor said the back roll is to help keep one from sliding down the pillow. I strongly recommend this pillow to anyone with GERD/acid reflux.	1
List price over $500, $300 here. That would sound good--except this exact ladder (Type 1, 22 foot, model 10303) is only $259 at the Little Giant website with free shipping, $249 from Home Depot again with free shipping. So the 'free work platform' is actually costing $40-$50 dollars...which is not exactly a bargain.I did eventually get one of these ladders and as long as you don't mind the weight (too much for my wife) they are amazingly convenient.	0

Yes, this isn't the best space heater I have ever owned, but it has a unique shape where it doesn't gather a bunch of dust, like past heaters have, and you can't beat the price for its performance.	1
"Well written, and realistic. Thomas is a well-meaning but rather tactless environmentalist. His brother Peter is more concerned about Thomas making a fool out of himself than trying to fix the situation. Just like in real life, there are no easy solutions but there are plenty of alibis and irrational negotiations from politicians (""If you'll just take back what you said...""). The only friend Thomas really has is the reader."	1
Clay Aikens debut cd is beyond outstanding. Each and every song you can feel him sing, as if he was singing to you. He is 100% talented even more so then i a true clay fan even though. The songs Perfect day and Measure of a Man combine true vocal talent and true writing talent to make perfection. There is not a single song on the cd that is skip worthy. It is amazing and Clay truly proved even though he might not be made for stardom he is talented and i would listen to him sing the alphabet because he is amazing!	1
"I just purchased the new Clay Aiken CD and I don't think I have ever been more disappointed in my life. I feel like this man's beautiful voice is no where even near 10% of what it is capable of on this album. Most of the songs don't even sound like him. I have waited for this to come out because his voice sends goosebumps up my spine when he hits ""those notes"", and I skipped through every song on this album and found none that even came close. I hope that Clay speaks up and says, this is not the measure of me, and his next album show cases his God given talent. When you hear songs like ""Bridge Over Troubled Water"" that are amazing and then listen to this album, you cannot even begin to compare. The only reason I gave it one star is because of the song ""This is The Night,"" other then that, I would not have rated it."	0
Some video game movies are great. Others are horrid. Super Mario Brothers goes beyond horrid! It seems as though nothing was thought out when writing the script for this movie and it does not resemble the game by Nintendo in anyway. If they had slapped a different name on this and changed the names of some of the characters I think this movie could have received 1.5 stars rather than just 1. There is nothing of value in this movie and I strongly suggest that you stay far away unless your looking for something to put yourself to sleep if you have insomnia.	0
Absolutely, mind-blowingly awesome! Steven Wilson is the master of multi-channel sound production. Only HE could put together a disc that can (almost) capture the experience of a Porcupine Tree concert. Not to be missed!	1
As far as I'm concerned the most important holiday every year is Academy Awards night, with the second most important being the day the nominations are announced. Obviously, the Academy Awards are my life and Inside Oscar is my Bible. No matter what page you open this book, you'll be totally drawn and completely forget about time. If I had one complaint it's that too much time is spent on recent years while earlier decades are given less attention. Still, it's such a wonderfully written book, so catty and bitchy, but all in fun; I can't wait for the next edition and find out all the shenanigans involving Titanic and how it's possible Helen Hunt beat Kate Winslet....	1
This by far the worst movie that I have ever paid to see at a theatre. That is not to say that it wouldn't make a good rental; where through multiple viewers you could knock the viewing price down to 15 cents a person, but then that would still be too much to pay for this movie. WWE Entertainment should stick to what it does best - wrestling events where the story line is better inside the squared circle. Outside of a Terminator reference made to Robert Patrick, this is a total waste of 91 minutes of your life.	0
Into the Wilderness was absolutely top-notch so maybe my expectations were too high for Dawn on a Distant Shore. This story contained little action and far too much gossip. These wonderful outdoorsmen (and women) were confined to rocking in ships for 300 pages! I was as homesick for the mountains as Hannah was. I love Ms. Donati's characters but I was as uncomfortable as they were in their oversea adventure. I do hope she brings them home for the next installment. If I hadn't read the first book I would never have finished this one - the plot was too much of a stretch - but the Bonners are terrific and I had to know what happened to them.	0
This movie doesn't even deserve one star. The script was horribly written, and they kept on playing the SAME thing over and over and over again. Little parts changed while they replayed it, but I knew I couldn't stand to watch ANOTHER rerun again. I had to watch this movie for German and I'm certainly not watching it again.	0
One of the best books you will find on the Army Air Force prior to and during World War II. This is one of the few authors that doesn't impose his opinions on the reader. He goes out of his way to give both sides of an issue or a personality. Even such controversial figures as Britain's Bernard Montgomery or our own Douglas MacArthur are treated with an even-handedness that is all too rare. Very entertaining and very informative.	1
"I HIGHLY recommend this album for ANY Clay Aiken fan! I have watched Clay from day one, when he entered that room with Simon, Randy and Paula, and declared himself the ""American Idol"". In my opinion, he IS the American Idol! I could not wait for this album to be released and I am NOT disappointed! The first three songs are wonderful---one of my favorites being ""Measure of a Man"", the title song of this CD. This is only his FIRST album and I predict the next to be even better! Congratulations, Clay, for the release of your first album! I look forward to watching it soar thru the charts!"	1
This book has it's place--and that place is in an American Literature course at a university. It was entirely too technical to be enjoyable. I was assigned this book as a ninth grader and now that I am a teacher and understand lexile levels, I must advise other teachers not to assign this book until the later grades--and only to the highest students.	0
This is the best book I have ever read. I will read it again and again. Mrs. Speare writes so well. Read it to find out. I'm not really writing a review, just stating my opinion ;)	1
Sp65 is difficult to program. Detailed instructions are not included with purchased item, and send you to a web page that is unavailable (www.sonicblue.com/support). I think this is a piece of junk!	0
I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do.	1
The authors do an excellent job of bringing together the essential information without overwhelming the reader. The book has many features which help the student bring the information together--outlines, study tables, and excellent review exercises. I highly recommend this book to any teacher or student teaching or taking a psychology class in tests and measurements.	1
I've had one house guest and one nanny place this kettle on my gas stove believing it's a standard kettle. The first time, I wrote Cuisinart a letter, and they graciously sent me a new kettle. Great customer service. The second time, I'm going with a less confusing design, the Capresso glass electric kettle for a couple extra bucks. It's not worth burning my house down ; ).This design looks just like Cusinart's other standard kettles. So if you have elderly parents, or people what are not familiar with recent developments in water boiling, you might want to consider a less confusing design. (p.s. the plastic base melts in seconds if it comes in contact with a heat source).	0
These bra inserts are very stiff and tend toslip out of place on your shoulder----they arerather heavy/bulky and more uncomfortable thanhaving a bra strap dig into you! I have sincefound lightweight ones that stay in place allday and were $1.99 a pair--(commonlyfound in the lingerie sections of most dept.stores).	0
"Note to all first time readers. This book was created for serialization and so comes across in a somewhat repetitive chapter formula. I read this in grade school and have yet to find anyone who truly disliked it. Journey To The Center Of The Earth is also a Classic, but I prefer this. Well written, with a unique story and good visuals throughout. The reader can clearly identify with the characters and their view of being on the Nautilus. Captain Nemo is an enigmatic person with many layers. In this one will see Man vs. man, and man vs. nature. For some the descriptions of various Marine life may seem over done. For me they gave context within a slide show of what truly made Captain Nemo tick. Mr. Verne's book deserves the appelation, ""far ahead of its time."""	1
This is the second Foundation Novel I have read in the whole series and it just gets me more excited for the rest. This book really brings into light the tone of the series and where it can go. Honestly Asimov is a genius. :)	1
My 5 yo got hooked on the Olsens by watching reruns of Full House on Nick and ABCFam. So I got a couple of videos for her to span the divide between her Dora years and whatever comes next! This is really a cute movie that even I enjoy watching several times over. I can relate to the parental roles and she can relate to the soccer and girly stuff. This led me to make more purchases of the video series and I hope the rest are as good. A nice relaxing watch!!	1
Love love them,my son goes 6hrs especially at night without a leak.These pampers are economical as he started using a size 3 at 5&1/2months and is now going to 9months yet he has not outgrown them.Would recommend highly.	1
Dredge is different from anyone I've heard yet. I can't Tell what this guy is singing about. By far Dredge has some of the most modern, but beautiful music out. Young musicians. you can call it emo maybe. evn if you hate emo check this album out. I bought it knowing nothing about it. Bug Eyes is fantastic, even though I have no idea what it means.	1
What the heck? This movie is rated R! The theatrical version was rated PG-13! Now I'm not allowed to get or see this movie, which was only mediocre to begin with. Great job!	0
THIS PRODUCT IS CONVENIENT BUT ITS ALSO THE SAME AS ANY OTHER PRODUCT I HAVE USED. EVEN THOUGH EVERYBODY'S BODY ACTS DIFFERENT, THIS WORKS THE SAME AS THE LIQUID FOR ME.	0
It seems like all of the reviews on here had problems with this warmer from one extreme to the other! My problem was that the warmer didn't warm the bottles at all. At one point, I left it plugged in for more than 30 minutes and it did almost nothing, which of course is unacceptable when you've got a hungry infant! Wouldn't bother with this one again and I recommend that anyone thinking of buying it doesn't waste their money!	0
Okay so I guess I didn't read the 1 or 2 reviews that said the case doesn't close shut.It clicks shut then flips open. Anyway I will return what is essentially a pointless product now. Very disappointed.Seems the build quality is inconsistent as most reviews said it shut fine but 1 or 2 did report this problem	0
Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them.	0
"As with the other reviewers, this printer worked fine for a short while, then I started to get the ""out of paper"" and ""paper jam"" errors. I contacted HP, and was told that I couldn't connect the power cord to my surge protector and had to go directly into a wall outlet. When that didn't work, I was told to unplug the printer, wait 30 seconds, plug it back in, then repeat 3 times. At this point I decided to just return the printer."	0
Before you buy this thing, understand one thing. When you mark a song, you have to remember the station you were listening to at that time. So if you have 10 emarks, you have to remember the station you were listening to at the time of each of the emarks. I wondered about this detail before I bought the thing and found no mention of it anywhere on their website. I assumed it would mark the station somehow. My mistake. Learn from it.	0
loved the dvd thanks Amy!! Hoping to be toned and firm by the end of this Summer!! If you enjoy step areobics you will enjoy this DVD check it out!	1
I've been buying Pampers Baby Dry on Amazon for many months. The price is being increased every month on the same product with the same quantity. Unacceptable. I love the diapers, but will most likely be buying from somewhere else from now on.	0
We are organizing our costume stock and large quantity safety pins are in big demand. Wish this came in a larger quantity, but they do serve the purpose.	1
Thanks to this book, I am now an amateur astronomer. I have a lot of astronomy resources but this is the one I use over and over again.This book is designed for someone without any experience and is an excellent guide for showing someone where to look. Within just a little while the reader will be looking at galaxies, nebulas, and globular clusters...Bob Flater	1
We bought this as a clearance item for a lot cheaper than what it's selling for on Amazon. This toy has been dropped, sat on, stepped on, etc. In other words, it survived a toddler and a little boy. It's so stupid it's fun. We've had a great time with it.	1
"Ballooning Book Takes Readers up, up and away!Maybe it was the photograph of the cow jumping over the moon; or several balloons cheek-by-jowl, jockeying for position during competition.Somewhere in George Denniston's ""The Joy of Ballooning"" (Courage Books) it became clear that thrills, cameraderie, humor, creativity and competition are all part of the ballooning experience.Imagine floating over the Snohomish Valley, or trying to be the first to float three miles to snag the keys of a pickup that are attached to a 30-foot-high pole, or taking your wedding vows in a sky-high ceremony.Denniston offers an overview of ballooning, from history and physics to extreme ballooning, special shapes and festivals.Sharon Wootton"	1
"This hardcover edition of The Daughter of Time is expensive and cheaply done. There are many appalling typos, the most absurd being "" Henry VIP"" for Henry VII. It possibly constitutes a copyright violation, with no publisher or publishing date information. The front cover picture is of Edward III, not Richard III. An insult to Josephine Tey's brilliant and well-written book. Read her book, just don't buy this edition!"	0

Keeps Coffee Almost As Hot As When Poured From Coffee Pot.I like mine piping hot. I'm picky. This does keep it almost that hot though.Nice Long Cord (Over 5 Feet)Off/On Switch Conveniently Located On Coaster Front.Four Grip Feet On Bottom. Doesn't Burn Surface Of Table. Doesn't Slide Around.Good Buy!	1
headphones need to withstand at least some not so ideal conditions. my AKGs and Sennheisers have survived more than 25 respectively 15 years of use. sometimes they got dropped or i fell asleep while wearing them. and they still serve me well 'til this day and still sound perfect. not so the Bose set i bought in 2004. in 2005 the plastic parts holding the ear pieces to the frame broke. i fixed them on one side just to see them break on the other. then the plastic skin covering the foam padding started to come off. apart from being annoying, the chemical stench coming from the foam was sickening. i gave up on repairing the set and just recently tossed it in the trash bin promising myself never to touch Bose, ever, ever again. i am happy with a cheap Koss set now that at a fraction of the price sounds about as good and it still works.	0
As one of the 100 greatest books written, at least this book doesn't leave you wondering why. It's a classic in it's sense of adventure, sci fi, and originality. Relatively short, this book keeps your interest throughout and it's main character of Captain Nemo is a true joy. In summary, a very entertaining book.	1
On a number of occasions, it had been suggested that I read this book, and I must say I'm very glad I did. I got very involved, as the writing was so wonderfully descriptive. Having said this, I don't think it was arduous to read all that detail, which sometimes makes reading a book feel a bit of a chore. I would recommend it to anyone!	1
What a disappointment. I can't believe how cheaply made this book is. I am glad I got in on sell or I would have returned it. The caring case is a zip lock bag. The pages can be easily ripped off. The pages are not plain paper and you put a mental page behind the story page. I could have do this on my own with the cheaper and FULL version of this book. The Magnet letters are VERY tiny. It really wasn't even worth the sell price. I'm a home daycare provider and I really feel ripped off. Shame on the makers of this book. The are some wonderfully made Magnet learning books by Top That! Including Counting with Magnetic Numbers (Magnetic Play and Learn) I wish I got more of these books instead	0
I loved this movie as a kid and still enjoy it. With the remastered deluxe edition the color is great.	1
I didn't read the specs very well and didn't see just how tiny this set is. While it is very nice, it is very tiny. The stamps themselves are rather small. My guess is that I could've gotten single stamps at a craft store for a bit less. However, it does come in a nice storage box and my son loves using them. Overall, I think they are well made and I would purchase again.	1
I've enjoyed reading this edition for its critical essays and helpful footnotes, but the copy I ordered from Amazon was missing thirty pages. (It turns out that pages 14 through 44 are printed twice, resuming at page 77). They may have corrected the problem in other copies, but don't assume that you'll get the whole book!	0
I use this to push my outdoor and upstairs speakers that have a higher (needs more power) sensitivity than my living room and dining room speakers. I take the tape out feed from my main receiver and plug it into the inputs of the Amp 100. The quality is amazing for the price; this thing is solid! I don't know if it is audiophile sound but I am not using it for that purpose and not pushing audiophile quality speakers with it. The product is absolutely perfect for what I am using it for. I highly recommend it to augment a whole house music system.	1
"The Oginski's style is very similar to the Chopin's. Well, they were both Polish and created in the same era. However I think I even prefer Oginski. I only wish that CD encluded the most famous Oginski's Polonaise: ""Farewell to the Fatherland"" (""Pozegnanie z Ojczyzna"")."	1
I am disappointed that the book has not yet come. I have always used Amazon and never had a problem before. I assume the seller is to blame. My calls have produced no results	0
I just wrote a review for another of Joann's books called A Bad Girl Creek Novel, this Book and Good-bye Earl are a set of 3 books that go hand in hand with one another. You won't go wrong with purchasing these books, this set is one that should definately be made into a movie.	1
This book is a drug. This book is a weapon. I'm almost surprised it's legal. But then a friend of mine tells me that people can get away with a lot more in books than they can in other mediums, because so few people read these days. Buy this book. Pick any page. Make sure it is daytime; reading late at night may cause insomnia. You do not have to finish or understand this book to enjoy it. It's like Joyce took all of human energy and made it into one huge handy random reference tome. Incredible. A sure cure for depression. When I discovered it I almost immediately felt like going out on the street and reading ramdom parts to random people.	1
I am now on my second Pioneer DVR 633HS.It's got to be the biggest piece of junk I have ever owned. They last about 2 months(or less), after that they do not respond to any controls and keep turning on and off on their own. My first one got so hot it could have set the house on fire had I not caught it. The hard drive locks up and keeps sounding like an old pulse tone telephone.Did Pioneer get rid of all educated engineers?I noticed this unit cannot even be purchased on -line at any web site anymore. This is sad after only a few months on the market. I will unload this piece of junk back to the dealer and buy any other brand but another Pioneer.	0
he has always wanted one of these for a long time. Now he's happy. He will be cooking hot dogs forever now.	1
The product does give the surround sound experience, which sounded okay in my cars audio system. However,this version is not the orchestral sound I was expecting. Rather it is more of an organ piece, which I find not as rich or vibrant.	0
This Book tells a story about two friends who are looking for a new job near the Salinas River in California. Lenny, who is mentally retarded, and George, the smart one. They had to escape from their last job because Lenny got in trouble. In the new job the story will be repeated, but this time for the last time. The only reason I gave this book a star is because is has a good plot, and because this is happening in the world right now, it is a reality. The main factor that called my attention was the vocabulary and quotations of the characters. This is why I give one star to the book.	0
"Musk Dogs...Fountainheads..and a spaceship that's been on the grill to long..Two crabby women that fight for 50 freakin' years or is 18,000 years! Yes I finished the book..I know why some wanted to leave the ""structure"".Granted the first part of the book is full of promise, chasing down Janus and the problems that ensue...but then the wheels fall off. Read the first 1/3 of the book then pick up something else."	0
In my last review I said this book makes for edgy, fascinating reading! It is hard to put this book down! I also read this book as a senior in high school, between ages 17 and 18 years of age!	1
I have been through two of these, each one only worked for a few months before going bad. After three months and only sporadic use, the first one I bought started cycling on-off continuously. This isn't apparent unless you are using it while plugged in, but the battery icon will show it is charging for a couple of seconds, then flip back to the battery icon for a couple of seconds and so on. I contacted the company, which confirmed it was faulty, so I sent it back to them for replacement. I received the replacement from Macally and after a couple of months, the second one started doing the same thing. I have read this is a pretty common occurrence with this product. I suppose there is a reason that it's a third the cost of the Apple product.	0
Listening to this synthesized 21st Century adaptation of a great classic could turn a classical enthusiast into a classical hater. After listening to this anemic attempt at capturing the power of a acclaimed musical portrait by using synthesized instruments, one is left to wonder why a recording company hasn't recorded this piece using a large orchestra. It just begs for the real thing. At least with a large orchestra there might be more justification to charge $23 for just 33 minutes of music. I would strongly urge classical music lovers to approach with caution if they are thinking of buying any of the other selections in this classical music series played by Alexander Jero. Too bad Amazon doesn't offer a money-back guarantee on opened CDs. As for the sound, it is enveloping, if you like to be surrounded by harsh virtual instrumentation.	0
"Myth: Great speakers are born. Dale Carnegie's ""The Quick and Easy Way to Effective Speaking"" may be a misnomer - it's not as easy as easy as the title may imply, but more importantly, he shows that it's nurture not nature that makes a great speaker. The book is filled with inspiring examples, tips and lessons. If you want to become a great speaker, this is a must read. You'll learn about the common pitfalls, the structure of the talk, the importance of introductions, conclusions, and much more. This book has stood the test of time and helped thousands of people, I'm glad to say that I'm one of them."	1
When my girls grew out of their swaddlers we moved on to the babydry and loved them. They fit perfect and have no leaks. I suggest pampers products to everyone I know. It is the only brand that has proved itself over and over to me and I trust on my sensitive kids bums.	1

Hey, I've only got one leg, but that doesn't mean I don't know GREAT blues music when I hear it!!! I love Memphis Minnie and her rough and roudy vocals and rockin' guitar style, she is the epitime of the BLUES. She sings everything from jump blues, rockin' blues, delta blues to dirty blues. She has plenty of pep and energy, and sinsg liek there's no tomorrow. her delivery will hit you like an intoxicatingly wonderful tornado. You will love this cd, one Legged Willy promises, there you have it, THE ONE LEGGED WILLY GAURENTEE!!!Bottom Line: Just buy it, one legged Willy gives it the thumbs up!	1
How on earth did anyone find a reason to give this total waist of time and money anything more than one star?A 'nowhere man' enters a drug trial that makes him think he has super powers.Looks like it was filmed on a home cell phone.Drug company tries to silence him to save money.Grass makes you think of pizza.Camoflage makes you immune to a hit and run.If this post seems a bit disjointed, you are getting a sence of this senceless plot.DON'T WAIST YOUR TIME OR MONEY.	0
This book was a disappointment in comparison to other Crusie books. Her books were my first foray into contemporary romance. The plot is not too developed or very interesting for that matter. And the main characters, they come off pretty flat.	0
This musical offering was a superb display of Clay's versatility and powerful range. I keep changing my mind on which song is my favourite. I find myself humming bits of each song when I am alone or walking along the beach. My only regret is that it may take some time before a second album is released and I am already anxiously awaiting that event and will definitely pre-order. Measure of a Man is my all-time favourite cd to listen to and I'm 49 years old so I've listened to a few!	1
"Yes the more emoish metalcore is becoming so ""trendy"" but that's cool, just as long as they're good, but for AMAZING metalcore, Red Chord is where it is at. This nine-song masterpiece ends in just under half hour and delivers some of the most intelligent compositions heavy music has heard. Sometimes so backwards that you can't even tell what's going and other times so bone-crushing that you have to step away from the speakers for fear of your life, but no matter what the riffs work together perfectly through each song. The guitarist is incredible. The drumming is superb as well, with lots of quick time changes and riffs that are played once, the man on the throne keeps it together and flowing. All in all this is great for fans of truly talented music and should be in your CD collection. BUY IT!"	1
"Up until 2005- this album has stood as the quintessetial Oasis CD. The songs are solid throughout and delivered with a very real swagger. This CD announced that straight ahead rock was still a viable music form just when rap and grunge and rap/metal seemed poised to make ""regular"" rock n roll disappear forever. The Gallaghers are characters and their sniping at other bands through the years has been entertaining (and most times they are right). You gotta love the ""who gives a @#$%!"" attitude from these guys.This cd is loaded with great songs, live forever, supersonic, up in the sky being the highlights. What's the Story is a bit more Beatlesque than this one, but this cd certainly gives its fair share of homage to the fab 4, the who, the stones and the rest of the original British Invasion."	1
I ENJOYED THE MOVIE THOROUHLY.WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE ESPECIALLY CHICANOS WHO CAN RELATE.MAKES ME WANT TO SEE THE MUSICAL.	1
This movie was not restored! It is the same quality and sound as the DVD I purchased from the dollar bin at WalMart several years ago! What a disappointment! I would like to return it, but I am guessing that since the bluray is open Amazon will not take it back. The special feature lasts one minute tops. I can't understand why they would release one of the best movies of all time in such terrible condition.	0
I hate this memory card I had been using for 3 months for Madden 2000 when it became corrupted.Do not get stick to the basic Nintendo pack.Don't mess around I have had a nintendo controller pack since I owned my nintendo 64 (about a year and half now) and have never had a problem.I tried to save a few bucks and got burned.	0
This is a very good cd if you are new to Anime Cd's that are not english. All of the songs on it are great. I am not new to this form of music anymore so if you are new to this form of music and are a Sailor Moon fan like me. This would be a very good buy. ;}	1
I've never wrote a review about any product. I'm usually satisfied. This however kind of ticked me off. The shoe had some weird stain on it when i first saw them. they were also not the right size. I ended up giving them away.	0
And the winner is......... Huggies.Pampers overnights makes a promise it cannot keep - '12 hours of overnight protection'.Not long after I began using pampers overnight I noticed my son was waking up wet. The kicker - when he wetted himself and his dad after a mere 5.5 hours with no diaper change on a long road trip. (Oops). I even tried plastic underwear - but even that could not help. .I finally figured out if my LO had more than one bottle the diaper merely could not handle the output. Yikes. I thought I would take a chance and try huggies. It's been a week and so far no complaints. He has even woken up dry after having a second bottle in the middle of the night with no diaper change. (tsk tsk but as any mother can tell you, do not mess with a sleeping baby or you will live to regret it). I will keep you posted on any changes!	0
This was a great movie, although not quite as good as the first one. I would still recommend for those Narnia lovers to buy it, just be prepared to be slightly confused from the skipping of books and information. It all makes sense at the end, but you may have to watch it several times for everything to fit with the first movie. If you've read the books, it's no problem, except if you're like me and haven't read the books since you were in 4th grade. Still good though, love to see where the kids end up.	1
This is one long story that really takes you into the depth of prehistoric times and rituals. It's wonderfully researched and finely detailed. I read with wonder all the recipes for medicine. What herb cured or maintained certain diseases. The movie does this book absolutely no justice. What was Darrel Hannah thinking when she signed up for that bomb? This book takes a look at human relations and the beginnings of communication. A great read.	1
Felicia's journey is an excellent novel. The background to both characters is well developed. Mr. Hilditch in particular becomes more sinister due to his overwhelmingly ordinary appearance. The intimations of his unusual childhood merely suggest that he may be more disturbed than his manner presumes. Mr. Hilditch's interactions with strangers in the presence of Felicia provide the most chilling insight into the purpose of his friendship with her. It is for this reason alone that the film fails so miserably. No reference is made at all to these brief conversations. As for Felicia herself, it must be said that her character is a little limp. There are few convent girls left in Ireland who show such naivety. However she does grow more likeable, but not enough to demonstrate why she should affect Mr. Hilditch so much.	1
I was really disappointed to find this pad is two seperate pieces; I assumed the mouse pad slid out, but it doesn't. It is wedged in the bottom; very inconvenient. I would not recommend it. The pad itself is fine, it does have a small loop of velcro on the rear to hold your AC cord, it catches on your clothes and I will probably cut it off.	0
I purchased two Mr. Coffee pads a month or so ago, I have tried different mugs with it and I find that they don't work, very well, they will keep the coffee lightly warmed at best. The pad get hot but it does not transfer the heat to the mug.	0
I purchased this item as I was going on a 3 hour trip home to see my parents. I plugged this in and waited almost 20min with a screaming baby and the formula was almost as cold as it was when I started. Huge waste of money!!!1	0
Love the new cd. I liked all the songs the first time I heard them. BUT each time I listen to them they grow in intensity and feeling for me. Great CD!	1
COME ON!!! I am a Musiq fan to the core. But we need more than just unclever words and same story scenarios. The only song worth listening to was the first one after the intro. I forced myself to listen to the rest. Womanopoly? Baby Mama Drama? What about love longs and decent ones at that. The second CD was a keeper. Musiq should practice his craft or lose a fan. Also...stop remaking original songs if you DO NOT have the voice for it.	0
Several times over the years I've tried to read this..but every time it just didnt catch my interest enough....still,i was pretty sure at some point it Might be worth trying again..... So after many years i finally downloaded it to kindle and wow, it was terrific... Now i'm hooked on reading the entire series. Try it, YOU might love it too!	1
Very cool looking bed, son saw it and was ecstatic. Instructions included were nearly worthless, multiple screws literally broke when screwing the bed; once FINALLY together, attempted to move it and the screwed in back fell off. The wood quality is similar to cardboard, not even as good of quality as cheap plywood. I will be returning this bed as soon as I can get it taken apart and back in the box.	0
This is one of the best albums of the decade! Every song is ear shattering and every song will take hold of you!	1
Ricky Martin is the best don't ... Ricky has a great voice and his songs are very well written. And he's very handsome too!	1
Final Analysis played great in my player and it was priced just right; not too pricy. The delivery was prompt and the DVD was in good shape.	1
The delivery was prompt. The movie is an excellent source of entertainment. Action packed. I hope they make another one in a few years.	1
I'm a good hoola hooper, but when it comes to the super advanced stuff that they are doing..NO WAY! Popped it into my dvd player once, I don't even know where it is now. I was so hard!	0
"The science of interpretting the hidden meaning of one's dreams is the key to unlocking the door to our unconscious psychic life. Sigmund Freud was the one who discovered that through our dreams we can explore our unconscious, which means that if we can unravel what our dreams mean, we can find out what our mind secretly wants and desires. These wants and desires are otherwise hidden and suppressed by our conscious mind because of our moral and social inhibitions and tensions. In fact, Sigmund Freud theories invented a whole new branch of treatment for neurosis. Freud's ""Interprettation of Dreams"" has its flaws, and his theories have been constantly modified and improved upon in accordance with new discoveries in contemporary psychology, but it was Freud who first put the wheels in spin.David Rehakauthor of ""Love and Madness"""	1
This could be a really great item. The length is perfect if you are a knee length skirt/dress wearer. The material is not bulky and stays static free. The fit is comfortable enough that I don't notice I'm wearing it under a dress. I gave it two stars though because of one detail that I find excessively annoying: the adjustable straps don't stay put. I have to adjust them every time I wash it (where they also become very twisted), every time I put it on or take it off. The straps slip throughout the day as I wear it... you get the idea. The annoyance this poses to me outweighs the other good features that it has. I will ditch it after this winter, unfortunately. If readjusting does not bother you, than there is nothing else wrong with this item.	0
Gave this to a friend in October.... they finally solved it in Dec when her relatives came to visit.... the Univ of Virginia student solved it! She will pass it on to our other friends for their birthdays...Really like the game, its made well and it is harder than you think. I actually had to get my William and Mary graduate to put it together! I also gave one to my Mom for Christmas, who has not solved it yet. She will pass it on to her ladies she plays cards with. Its fun and different....a good conversation piece!	1
This is a dreadful movie. Anybody who tells you that it resembles the show obviously hasn't seen one of them. The plot is like something you would find in a kid's story book, the graphics are from the Ren & Stimpy school of animation, and the characters don't sound the same even though they were done by the same people. This is surely enough to include SPONGEBOB on anyone's list of the worst 100 films of all time. Guess that means I need to see SANTA AND THE ICE CREAM BUNNY to see if in fact anything worse for kids was ever put to celluloid.	0
As a licensed psychologist I LOL when I saw Dr.Freud in the Religion/ Spirituality section. It seems the profession has made some progress.	0
Ordered this for Christmas about 3 weeks before it never came before or after, never had any response, very disappointed.	0
This disc proves that there's much more to the Campbell/Webb association than the 4 or 5 hits from the late 60s we all know and love. 'The Moon's A Harsh Mistress', 'Highwayman', 'Lightning in a Bottle' and 'If These Walls Could Speak' are particularly fine Webb songs and they're given superb renditions by Campbell. The chemistry has always been right between these two and I hope it's not the last we hear of them together.	1
This had my heart in my throat from the verybeginning. It's about time they made a horror movie with strong female leads that doesn't degrade them or use them as eye candy dangled in front of a sadistic killer.This movie had a lot of layers to its characters and the creatures were freaking scary!	1
I came across this book while on vacation in New Orleans. The book is extremely well put together and the historical photos interesting. The testimonies by the women involved in the life make the book hard to put down and make for more factual and better reading than any scholarly reasearch book on the topic. This is a must have for anyone interested in the topic or as a coffee table book.	1
Good product, works just as described. Easy to install. Have not had any problems thus far.	1
Great toy, well made, good for learning, bu c'mon, $20 + bucks is too much for this type of toy.	1
I was looking for a doll-that-wets to help me potty train my 3 year old daughter. The doll was quite expensive, the only one with the feature I was looking for in that particular toy store. It comes without any instructions, or maybe they were missing from the box, but I really doubt that. When you give the doll water it instantly starts peeing, better when it is laying down than when it sits on the potty. No matter how you turn it and how you close or open the valve, IT LEAKS. I could not see any tears no matter how I turned it. Overall, big waste of money, I would STRONGLY RECOMMEND AGAINST IT. It makes a big title of glory that doesn't need batteries, but it absolutely does not rise to the expectations listed on the box, and I would personally get a battery doll that works, than this one.	0
A young girl named Emily that lives in Washington. Her Mother is sick with a cough that can kill her. Her Father died in the Civil war. She misses her Father so much because they were so close. The book only starts like this but it is a really good book. I like the book because I has sapience and horror, like the part when Abraham Lincoln dies and they blame it on... So it is one of the greatest books and you should read it.	1
Mercy starts with a bang and doesn't let up until the final surprise.Lots of fun to read, lots to think about. Mercy was hard to put down. I enjoyed the Palma character.I would recommend to anyone who likes a good detective story. I have passed it to several friends who also enjoyed it.	1
I am currently in school for my bachelors in culinary and this book is a must have for all students i believe i have only started to read it but so far it is great	1
"I was glad to see my mother at work at MGM two years before I was born. I am 73 years old.Mother was an MGM starlet in 1934. I had not been able to find a copy of this short after it was seen in part on TCM. I wrote TCM and searched the IMDB to no avail.And then this collection appeared! It fills the bill and is probably also appreciated by William Powell and Myrna Loy fans as well.Mother stars in the short musical film ""Dancing on the Ceiling."" She plays the dentist. What is significant about this film is that it may have been the precursor to the ceiling dancing film done by Fred Astiare.This short is not associated with the Lionel Richie, Frank Sinatra or Ella Fitzgerald works of the same name done more recently.I am still looking for a copy of the first MGM Technicolor musical short which starred Mother titled ""Gypsy."""	1
I was not happy with this book. Luckily I checked it out at the library, so I did not spend the money on it. It was filth, trash, and poorly written at that. I wanted the erotic sensations like the vampires get when drinking blood. Instead I got nothing but sorry, flabby writing that went nowhere. If the book had belonged to me, I would have burned it!	0
This book should occupy a prominent place in your collection. Yes its ok to own more than one book on sartorial correctness. Take this book for its strenghts (i.e.,the correct way to buy fine clothes) and don't worry about its drawbacks. This is an excellent source for learning about the theory and practice of dressing like a proper man. Much has been made about the outdated addresses of some of the stores in the second half of the book. Well my response is..get over it. Fine mens stores change addresses, its a fact of life. The important thing is the name and description of the store. With that said, sit back and enjoy the text and pictures and take responsibility for being a well heeled gentleman...if you dare.	1
This adapter is perfect for my Series 2 DT Tivo box.Setup was effortless and now I can connect to my Tivo Box online. It's great!	1
If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants.	0
After reading all of the reviews for this book, I thought it would be pretty good. However, I found it to be predictable. The story-line seemed be dragging at several points in the book and I just wasn't buying THE REASON for Adrian's betrayal- it seemed unrealistic.	0
The Pampers Baby Dry diapers seem to be leaking often even after a new diaper has been put on. I changed my son's diaper and it leaked within 15 minutes on 2 occasions. They seem to fit him well and are soft and cute, but somehow aren't effective. I'm sure that it's like many products. They work extremly well for some, but for others, the product does not work.	0
God, another European power / melodic metal band !!! THis one had a good start, possessing Kai Hansen along their ranks. So I went for it !! What a deception!!! It's so repetitive, boring, dumb. If you like real metal, I can say these guy tried to do it, but failed miserably !!	0
"We use a different variety of Pampers diapers on monthly delivery. We were running short and bought a box of these ""Baby Dry."" For some reason, they do not work at all. They leak through the legs."	0
This is an absolutely fabulous CD. There music is fun and diverse. The lyrics are great and meaningful. The rhythms are wonderful and energetic. I would recommend this CD to anyone who loves Bachata or wants to get to know the music. I loved all the songs from Confesiones. My favorites are: Te Quiero Igual Que Ayer, Polos Opuestos, No Regresare, Cuando no se puede olvidar......It'll make you want to dance all night!!!	1
"As a retired negative wedding photographer, I want spot-on results. But with the digital age I had trouble getting exposure/white balance correct. Yes, the processor could correct for my ""slight"" errors. I did not appreciate how important white balance was, nor that it can change as easy as exposure. After a couple of tests w/this card. I was amazed at the skin tones I got. I used a drug store type quality (Costco) for convenience & speed and got great exposures! Just think what a higher quality firm (i.e. Dale Labs) can do with my files!Photo correction programs: Just use the ""eye-dropper"" tool; get color corrections- presto!Short comings: The cards could be larger! The instructions could be more detailed- The makers of this product could benefit from comments here!"	1
"I'll admit it freely- I only bought this book because of how desperately I fell in love with the recent Disney movie ""John Carter."" I just had to read the original story, and I'm not disappointed. For the time period it was written in, A Princess of Mars is well beyond its time, and absolutely satisfies my need for good writing. The storyline is altered from the movie, but a good read nonetheless. I thoroughly enjoy this book and am regretful of not reading it sooner."	1
I started reading the book and will have to stop and learn mathematical notation and some terminology first . I'm hopeful the infomation is correct , but it is over my curious head at the moment .	0
"This baby dry diaper is supposed to be used for longer duration at nights. Out of the 5 diapers I have used, the gel balls from 2 of them burst and spread all over the house. I have been using the pampers swaddlers and the pampers cruisers but never had issues with them. I will never buy the pampers "" baby dry"" diapers again."	0
"maybe they are clever enough to figure out why these actresses,directors, producers, etc. are still in circulation.This film is not only BORING BORING BORING but also an INSULT to everyone ... except perhaps the Far Eastern looking ""actress"" who gets to play the ""friend"" of the protagonist, and who fairly deliberately ruins what was supposed to be a one night-stand (one-night lay to be more precise) anyway, on the part of the slow, but dark-looking Italian HOD (hunk of the day, my abbreviation, he-he). Don't worry, a bearded, rugged looking American is going to fill the Italian's rubber shoes ... Sorry for italianizing and americanizing but there is more than enough of that going on in the film, at least on the DVD version.The film forgot to elaborate on the potential dangers of adult owls snatching kittens though, as it's a romantic, and not a realistic view of the world, and it was definitely not meant to be a horror flick. Then again, some of the scenes are pure horror."	0
Brian Weiss ha dejado una magnifica guia para quienes no tienen mucha informacion acerca del Hipnotismo, La historia de Katerine es tan impresionante que podria ayudar a culquier persona que se ha hecho la pregunta mas de una vez sobre la continuidad de la vida.	1
This book is far too basic, with information easily found by a quick internet search. Scarce on facts and high on opinion, this book was clearly written with someone unfamiliar with medicine but with marketing savvy.	0
After being a smart English teacher for 41 years in Venice, I've reached the conclusion that Nineteen Eighty-Four is a vivid satire on the Russian Revolution. I read this book on the Supreme 747 PowerJet on my way to Australia. Despite being disturbed several times by male-stewardesses, I was able to tell that this was a fantastic book. It is unfortunate that this book caused the writer years of sickness and was bedridden for the remainder of his life. And that I was not included in his will. read this book!Judas man Vanen	1
but not Andrew McCarthy's best work. Still, I enjoy Andrew in just about anything. If you want a relaxing movie where you don't have to think too much to figure out the plot, this is for you.	1
I intended to use this ball in my office, but it arrived (totally unlike the picture) with cartoony hieroglypics of a man doing exercises all over the ball. It looks stupid and I cannot use it in my office. What a lie. Also, it didn't come with a pump, even though it says there is one on the box!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"I bought this model 18 months ago. Now it has big problem. I can't rewind the tape well. ""remove the tape"" mesasge always pop up. I sent it back to Canon for repair. They asked me $169 for repair. What can I say now? Too bad camcorder."	0
Great, just great. My 5 year old sister got this innapropriate toy, AND NOW WANTS A SKIRT JUST LIKE THE DUMM BABY HAS! THE SAME LENGTH, TOO! Now my sister wont shutup about it! And she started to become rude to my mom, when she is only 5! What next, drugs? All because of the stupid toy, my 5 year old sister is now turning into some teenager from a gang!	0

"Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."	1
A good product, but costs a bit too much. I needed this and couldn't find it in any of the stores around where I live.	1
Bought this item for my son for christmas, the rollers will not turn, looks like I wasted my money, buyer beware!	0
Highly recommended, I find this canopy durable, an ease to install, and made of high quality construction. For the past 3 years, I have rented similar type canopies for my summer B.B.Q.'s. These rentals exceeded over $300.00 per occasion. Now, I can enjoy this canopy and at the same time save hundreds of dollars on the rental fee's.	1
I got hooked on the storyline despite the repellant descriptions of decaying bodies and maggots. Kept wondering what the main character, Tempe Brennan, looked like. No description ever given. All the loose ends were tied up at the end, except how Ryan knew about Brennan's mugging. A recommended alternative to Patricia Cromwell's Kay Scarpetta, whose plots and charaterizations are getting weaker and weaker.	1
"All I had ever heard of Garbage were a couple of their music videos until my friends persuaded me to buy this CD. Now I listen to it at least twice a week. I usually go for music with lighter lyrics, but I've fallen head-over-heels in love with all these songs, even ""Medication"". As much as I love the whole CD, I do have favorites: I listen to ""When I Grow Up"" and ""Hammering in My Head"" so much I'm bound to wear the CD out!"	1
Allow me to summarize this film for you.A self-centered, rude and unlikeable Morrissey fan licks Morrissey posters and basically deludes herself into believing that she is going to marry him.I understand that the film is intended to be funny and over-the-top, but the humor is merely vulgar and mean spirited.Before someone accuses me of simply not like Morrissey or of being a victim of Hollywood formula, let it be known that I am both a huge Smiths/Morrissey fan and an admirer of independent films. Despite these facts, I couldn't bring myself to enjoy any aspect of this film.	0
Good product, kinda pricey but works much better than having the Tivo plugged into a phone line.	1
"Huff has found a catchy title to lure readers into the dry-sounding but utterly fascinating world of statistics.Packed with examples from the 1950s which seem as fresh as yesterday, this book shows how advertisers and others try to trick us by misusing statistics. ""Figures don't lie, but liars figure."" could be the unwritten motto of this book. Almost every day I see a Gee Whiz graph which makes something look like it's skyrocketing out of control before I check the scale. Then it turns out that a 5% or 10% bump looks like 600% to 1,000%. The trick is to abuse the visual impact of the graph.A company might cut wages 30%, then later increase them 30% and claim that they have restored the cut. Huff explains why this is actually a 9% pay cut! This is one of many weapons in the statisticulator's arsenal.Huff, aided by Geis's amusing and revealing illustrations, teaches us how to defend ourselves from statistical abuse, by showing us how the tricks are done."	1
"Anthony's works are all easy to read and the world of xanth draws you in automatically; I guess its the bookworm's equivalent of junk food--not nourishing for your literary education but satisfying nothenless. This book was one of the ""better"" books of Xanth--although i have yet to find one that didn't leave me rolling on the floor and lauging. Its fun reading about a barbarian...they aren't the typical main chracter after all and its interesting how Piers Anthony manages to make something fearsome seem silly and human."	1
This series is, for me, stronger when Hornblower is a young officer learning his craft and developing his skill base. This was a book I enjoyed and which prompted me to continue with the series to the end.	1
The on/off switch is stuck. I cannot therefore record or review tapes. I pried the switch and made a temporary contact and confirmed that the camera can record and play-back I would like to be able to return it for full credit or have it repaired.	0

This is one of my favorite Sherlock Holmes tales, and I was thrilled that it could be acquired so cheaply for my Kindle. However, whenever a character reads out loud from a newspaper or other document, the passage being read is missing from this Kindle edition. As such, information vital to the tale is missing. Terrible! Spend more money, and get a comprehensive (and comprehensible!) version.	0
It must be me! This is the second purchase of mine to find something to tighten the hex nut on my reading glasses. The nutdriver is too big for the nut.(The same was true for the other key chain product I bought) I currently use a tweezers to tighten them, which does scratch the glass by the base of the nut. I won't try a third time....I'll use the tweezers.	0
The adaptor that comes with the Apple Powerbook did not last as long as it should have! Then to charge that expensive cost for replacement...Shame on them! I accidentally dropped and bent the first adaptor that I bought from you and replaced it and still have enough left over to buy another if needed!!! WHY? Apple?	1
I have been looking for this adapter for some time now and found it at Amazon.com. The price is great, arrived before schedule, in new condition but did not work in my car. Everything fit properly but it would not charge my phone - I did not notice an illuminated LED which would indicate power input. In all fairness, my cigarette lighter may be on the brink and therefore not transferring current/voltage; I doubt it though. I had already thrown away the packaging so I couldn't return it so now I'm stuck with it.Maybe once I insert it into another vehicle, it may work. For now, this is it.	0
Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again	1
"Buy it and listen to it once and you will never want to turn it off. The songs are wonderful, and the way he sings them will move you in many ways. I was brought to tears by ""The Way"", it is so beautiful. Finally an artist who will not compromise his beliefs and delivered a great, personal debut album.A must buy!"	1
ATTENTION!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!I REAPEAT!DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.IT IS BUGGY AND NO FUN WHAT-SO-EVER.THANK YOU FOR LISTENING	0
this book was okay, but it wasn't the best book i have ever read. its basically a cheesed-up romance novel about a 12-year-old. its a bit unbelievable and unrealistic, but it got exciting at the end of the book.	0
"This 1985 album by Bunny Wailer is by no means, his best work. That honor goes to ""Blackheart Man"". But ""Marketplace"" does contain some fine pop-reggae tunes such as Stay With The Reggae, Electric City, and Jump Jump. Plus the album cover is great! I recommened picking this up if you can find a copy."	1
Firstly, Escaflowne is a great classic anime, and one of my personal favorites. The visuals are a bit dated (1995), but what made the show was the plot, the world, and the audio!2nd, All of the Escaflowne CDs are incredible. Especially lovers only (a 'best of' for the series), and the movie soundtrack. This is all due to the work of Yoko Kanno (Cowboy bebop, darker than black, Macross, RahXephon, among other greats). Escaflowne may be my favorite of all her work, but everything she touches turns to gold.Lastly, the CD Info, because it is often hard to find the correct information:The Vision of Escaflowne OST 3Yoko Kanno19961 Short Notice2 Arcadia3 Epistle4 Farewell5 Aoi Hitomi6 Perfect World7 I Recomment Instincts8 Scrappy9 Shrilly10 Revenge11 Illusion12 Blaze13 Fatal14 Hikari No Naka E15 Again	1

After using a different type of Pampers, we purchased these. My 10 week old premie has had numerous blow-outs in these diapers. His clothes end up wet often and they feel much cheaper material than Pampers Swaddlers. I definitely won't purchase Baby Dry diapers again!	0
Length:: 0:05 MinsI researched all types of hiking boots on the web, and these are the best. Good durability, comfort etc. I finally ordered the boots and waited. Finally the boots arrived, and yes they were very comfortable and arrived in good condition. Unfortunately the Dark Chocolate color is so dark that it is almost black. I am sure this will grow on me, but the picture on the web site is inaccurate and gave a false expectation. The picture is just a little darker than the CHOCOLATE color, but the reality is different. Actually the color is nice and it will hide the dirt, just not what I expected.	0
What if the third secret of the miracle of Fatima would upset the Catholic Church as we know it? That is the premise of Steve Berry's take on Vatican politics, papal infallacy and faith itself. Some Catholics may take much offense at the way the pope and the cardinals are portrayed, as truly there are some evil ones in this book. There is blackmail, murder, lies and deception and the overall portrait of the church is certainly not a pretty one. Father Colin Michener, who is secretary to Pope Clement XIV is sent on a mysterious mission to uncover the facts behind Marian visitations. He is joined by an old lover, an atheist reporter named Katherine Lew, and finds himself in danger at every turn. Much information is given on the miracle at Fatima and the mechanism behind the election of a new Pope. The writing is good and the plot holds your interest. Issues of celibacy, homosexuality, abortion are all addressed. A thought provoking if somewhat disturbing read.	1
Pro - Product is of the highest quality. Con - I'm looking for rivets to fit this unit and can't find them!! Amazon do not carry them.	1
"Del Shannon wrote some of the most distributing and depressing songs in rock music. The eerie landscapes and sounds of songs like the classic ""Runaway"", ""Hats Off to Larry"", ""Keep Searchin' (Follow the Sun)"", ""Little Town Flirt"" & ""Stranger In Town"" speak of true heartache and despair. The sound that Mr. Shannon created was original and nothing before or since has quite matched the moodiness of these songs."	1
I know bad music when I hear it. Here 'tis. The lead singer is the main problem, the band are not too bad, just apparently under the leadership of this mo. Go back to mommy and daddy in TX.	0
This autobiographical acount by Sterne of his amorous progress through France and Northern Italy is surely one of the most delightful books ever written. Composed as he lay dying of tuberculosis, the book nonetheless encaptures the author's renowned zest for life as well as the libertine spirit of the age in which he lived. The journey down through France to Northern Italy is the perfect vehicle for an excursion into the nature of human sensibility, and from the moment that this cultured Anglo-Irish cleric sets foot in Calais, the reader is treated to a seies of exquisite encounters with the fairer sex. Rarely has an author transmitted so well his understanding of the psychological complexity of women, or the pleasure he takes in their company. Engaging, perceptive and witty, this is a book whiich cannot fail to leave an imprint on the imagination.	1
"I enjoyed this book a lot, once I got past the slow parts. Hester Prynne is found pregnant out of wedlock. Since she won't reveal the identity of the father, she is forced to wear the Scarlet Letter ""A"" on her chest for the rest of her life. She gives birth to a girl and she changes her life around, so at the end of the book, people refer to her as ""Angel"" instead of ""Adulterer.""This is a timeless tale because the situation could easily happen in any time period. When we do something wrong, the way we live our lives afterwards is the determining factor of our moral character. One event does not define us. It's our entire lives that should be taken into account. I think that is Nathaniel Hawthorne's point. Redemption is possible for anyone, regardless of their sin. Also, the father who remained unknown to the society but not the reader, suffers enormously because he doesn't confess. This is a good point. When we hide our sins, the only person it ultimately hurts, is us."	1
Have read this book at least 3 times. This edition is excellent if you have good eyesight. The print is very small and not very dark. I read it under a very bright light and it was fine. It would be good for a student. Good to read on a train on the way to work because it is so lightweight.	1
"This is one of the best written books I have had the opportunity to read. Those of you who gave it a 1 are ignorant. And dont worry Sheri, he wont be writting anymore books seeing as how he has been dead for a while now. Before you criticize the writing of a wonderful author please learn how to spell correctly.1984 is a wonderful trip into the human mind and it shows how those of us in charge can and will do anything to remain in charge. It is a very good follow-up to Animal Farm. They both describe power hungry and greedy people can go to extreme measures to keep that power.Those who said the government would never end up like this are fooling yourself. The future could very easily end up like this. With the formation of the ""Homeland Security"" it is becoming even more likely that this may well be the future of the world. (Of course thank goodness 1984 wasnt really like that)"	1
Momento is a continuation of Gilbertos bossa nova lineage and the near perfect production shouldn't be minimized. Gilberto creates moods backed by rhythm and song and she hasn't done it better than on this disc -- really a perfect marriage of Tanto Tempo and it's gorgeous follow up Bebel Gilberto. I had the pleasure of seeing her perform with a symphony orchestra a few months ago and the songs here were alive and shimmered with orchestral backing -- Bebel herself is sublime. A true talent that will be around for years to come.The Shine of Dried Electric Leaves	1
The gyroscope was shipped and received very quickly. The product was in excellent condition. Just like the ones I played with when I was younger. My nephew loved it. Thanks.	1
Very bad Keanu Reeves film that could be one of the worse films ever made. Keanu sinks it up so badly that he should be thrown out of Hollywood all together and they should include the director and the screenwriters as well because the movie is as bad as Keanu's performance. Out of the entire cast only Rachel Weisz gives a real performance in this movie and she is so good in fact that she does almost redeems the entire film but not even her great talent could save it from the script, which is excruciatingly bad and the direction, which is as bad as the script and lacks focus for what its trying to accomplish. The story makes no sense and manages to go against itself in certain scenes and the climax literally destroys the narrative that the movie was trying to build up.Maybe asking for a competed director and a lead actor who can act was a tall order for the producers of this film.	0
"does not fit the new 15"" june macbooks or 17"". the F-Keys are in the wrong place, it fits a Tibook g4 BUT NOT THE NEW MACBOOKS BE WARNED.

We had been using pampers sensitive swaddlers since birth but when baby hit size 2 figured we would use up the pack of size 2 baby dry's we recieved as a shower gift..well within the first day of use my baby got a horrible diaper rash!So bad that her skin is bleeding and cracking :(..They even feel cheaper...way more of a plastic type feel to them. I do not reccomend!	0
"When purchasing this from Amazon Prime (not a third-party seller), the item that you will receive is not the Mega Playland, but rather the Megaland model. It has three compartments and two tunnels but is a a much different configuration. It can only be configured in an ""L"", not a straight line like the pictured Mega Playland model."	0
Wish I had read the reviews first. I had no idea how bad the sound quality was before I bought this.	0
Saved alot of money. Looks brand spank'n new and works like a charm.I have purchased two other remanufactured cusinart products from Amazon and they were also about 70% less than retail and they both were like brand new.	1
A great representation of the era of glam rock as created by Bowie. Overlighted, fuzzy images create an aura of the days of raw punk music whose power has endured long after it was created. The sound is pretty good considering the recording prowess of the seventies. A necessary addition to your video music catalog.	1
This product worked for 4-5 times and the rotation stopped working. Batteries run out or lose power after 3-4 uses. I would read reviews before buying another one... I am looking into the Hitachi wand massager now and I believe I will buy it since is a power operated toy and will never run out of power.Not impressed with this product.	0
Even though it is free, and I appreciate that, there was about a chapter missing. I would suggest this either be fixed, or the book removed from sale.	0
I am pleased with the rod as it fit the small shower enclosure. It did fall only once after I put it up, but I retightened it and it's remained in place ever since. Excellent value for the dollar	1
It's all good. This album suffers from a common problem among metal albums in that almost all the songs sound very similar, but in this case it just doesn't matter because it's all enjoyable. From the haunting vocals to the masterful pacing of the instrumentals, every song on here is actually fairly inspiring to listen to, clich√© as those descriptions sound. Definitely worth a buy.	1
Got this and several other styles for Christmas and this one is great. It gets the answer 95% of the time. Even my little grandkids like it for the sparkly lights.	1
Of Mice and Men by John Steinbeck is a classic tale of loyalty and friendship. It is about two friends named George Milton and Lennie Small who are a couple of laborers going from job to job. Steinbeck is able to capture the personalities of two poverty stricken friends during the great depression. George, a small out spoken man is responsible for Lennie, a larger hardworking man whom is mentally retarded. Both share a common dream of owning some land and being treated fairly. But a cloud of bad luck shadows them. Of Mice and Men was well written and easy reading	1
I read this because my husband had to buy it for a college course and it was actually a really good play to read :) The only part I hate about reading plays is keeping who says what straight!	1
Hardly anything past exotic stepcercise playing at your local gym save the oft-cited and featured-elsewhere PNG.	0
I love these. They are less expensive than the other Pampers and they are softer and work very well. I used the Pampers Swaddlers when my son was smaller than size 2 and after that I switched to these. He is 26 month old now and he is 23 pounds and he is using size 5. He is on 3 percentile weight and I do not go with the weight chart for these diapers as in that case I have to use size 4. You will know when to switch to upper size, when it gets full over night or it leaks # 2. I guess soon I have to switch to size 6 as it is almost exploding in the morning. I used costco brand and Huggies, but I did not like them. With the subscribe and save the price of these are better than the other brands.	1
This book is one of the best in the Saint-Germain series. This is the second book I have bought, since the first one was read so many times it fell apart.	1
OK, people, all I have to say is this thing sux. The price may be low, but the thing is just plain crappy. And I though CD players were supposed to play music...	0
I was very excited to buy this scanner and was pleased with its size and weight. However, if you have a Vista operating system, like I do, IT WILL NOT WORK! The company told me that they stopped selling this product over a year ago and there are no driver updates available for this product. If you have an older computer and an older operating system this product might work for you. But as for me it was a waste of money!	0
This is a fantastic life after death experience written by a physician, whose credentials give greater weight to his testimony. He leads up to this miraculous event by recounting his life experiences, a bit of biography. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it encouraged me tremendously after the recent death of my son, who had also proclaimed his faith in Christ before God took him. I enjoyed the book so much, I read it twice.	1
I bought this for my child who said she wanted to be a veterinarian. He was board to death with this bland, uninteresting book. Isn't there a good book out there for kids on this topic?	0
"I picked up this book for English class and after reading it I can respect how many people really enjoyed this book and I can see why. It is written well and it does keep your interest. John Steinbeck's style is very unique and it is semi-enjoyable to read (although every other sentence contains a swear word.)The story is about two men, George and Lennie, who always look out for each other. Lennie is, well, ""different"" in that he loves to touch soft things. He has the mind of a two year old. George does his best efforts to look after Lennie, although Lennie does get into a lot of trouble. After being chased away from their previous town, George and Lennie get new jobs in hopes to someday own a ranch of their own.Though this book was written well and the plot was good, I didn't like the story line. It was very depressing and was annoying for me to read. Maybe I'm just one person in a million who didn't enjoy this book. Try it out and see what you think."	0
Probably more useful as a soup cooker or steamer. The rice always seems to come out browned and hard on the bottom even if you double the recommended amount of water.	0
"One of the three ""Cat Stevens"" films that immediately preceded the breakthrough ""Trinity"" films, Terence Hill and Bud Spencer are not yet in the full characters they are famous for. The film is interesting mainly for the glimpses of how the Trinity/Bambino characters were developed. Do not expect comedy, although there are a couple moments of it. Directing OK but film shows its age and circus scenario will be too exotic for many tastes. Some viewers will find the film more dull than moody or stylish (as the director seemed to intend). Film was pretty well received by audiences in the late 1960s, according to the Hollywood Reporter."	0
i never get the item but was my fault i order to other adress sorry but i guess is a good product	0

I fell for these great reviews, but found out there is really nothing special about this rice cooker except for the price and the reviews to justify spending more for the same thing.After a couple of months of use, the inner pan peels off, had bad scratches. Talk about the worst customer service.I wish someone I've read a more truthful review on this product prior to buying.Save your money.	0
I bought this as a replacement board for a 10 y/o opener. The original board was permanently fastened to the opener chassis and had to be cut off. I then had to drill holes in the side of the opener and fasten the new board with two screws. Unfortunately Liftmaster uses the same exact stock numbers without indicating that there were changes made. In the end it works perfectly but is no job for amateurs.	1
"This was a horride movie. It had some creepy sceans, but the story was flater than paper. This proves that a movie doesn't need special effects to be scary. I saw ""The Sixth Sense"" and that was much better (And more scary) than this movie. Don't waste your money."	0
"I saw the tour of this ""album"" as a GI stationed at Lindsey AS Germany in 1982. They played two songs from this CD; first they played ""Under Pressure"" which the crowd went nuts for. Then they played ""Body Language"" and I swear the crowd went stone quiet. Needless to say, the band didn't play another song from this album. I only give this review two stars because ""Under Pressure"" is when of the best songs they have ever written. Other then that, like my German friends in 1982, I find this to be awful. The worst in their glorious career."	0
This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable.	1
The Pampers Baby Dry Diapers are great. If any mom's out their have a little one who screams the minute the pamper is soiled then this is a must have. The dry protection is so great my little 3 month old can sleep 8-9 hrs straight through the night with out a change. Plus I love the straight to my door process from Amazon mom, it is one less thing I have to worry about and can spend more time with my little one.	1
The picture quality was terrible. I feel there was no in-studio adjustment to improve on the picture quality. Just felt cheated!	0
Unless you have soemone at home to press it one hour before meal. Otherwise it takes at least 40 minutes to make rice ready. It is not good for both those couples without enough time for cooking. It take 1 hour and 30 minutes for stick rice. which is crazy for me....	0
This is a fantastic resource for any teacher. The ideas generated in this book are invaluable and can be modified for any age/grade level. Forms are instantly usable. Great for someone who's never seen a rubric right up to those who use them all of the time. I can't wait to share it with all the teachers at my school!	1
Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres.	0
Totally unbelievable and bad in all respects. Really worthless. Only reason I give it two stars is because the [Vietnamese girl]is not bad to look at when they first abduct her.	0
I enjoyed this in spite of my intense dislike for Adam Sandler movies. The film somehow manages to be genuinely funny, heartwarming and sincere, overcoming Sandler's natural tendency to go for the cheap laughs. Drew Barrymore is wonderful as the adorable amnesiac who starts each day with a fresh slate. Adam Sandler plays the smitten admirer who wins her over, only to find he is completely forgotten the next day. And the next. And the next.Rob Schneider is more irritating than funny, except for the scene where Drew beats the crap out of him, but the rest of the supporting cast is a joy to watch.You'll smile. You'll laugh. And, believe it or not, you'll root for Adam Sandler.Recommended!	1
This is a very attractive game. Cool cover art. Neat purple wooden mice and two fun dice with a sleeping cats, dinner bowls, and left pointing arrows. You basically take turns rolling these dice and either: doing nothing, giving a mouse to the player on your left, taking a mouse from the dinner bowl, or putting a mouse in the dinner bowl.That's all there is to it. There is no strategy whatsoever and no where to grow once you master the mechanics of rolling dice and moving mice. My four-year-old has wanted to play it once since we bought it, but to me it's a very tiring ordeal. I envy the cats sleeping on the dice.This game is good for teaching very young children how to take turns and roll dice, but not a whole lot more. Just think that when you buy a game this simple for young children, you will likely have to play it with them, over and over and over.	0
I saw this movie 3 times. It's an incredible movie and is worthy of all the praise it can get. The acting and directing is top notch. Also the story is great. Can't wait to see Bale and Nolan again in a few years.	1
This book is so typical of Southern Families with a strong matriarchal leader. I laughed out loud while reading because Ms Smith uses comical pharses I have grown up hearing. This is an awesome book.	1
"Jiggle's last studio album, ""In It Again"" is a totally different animal than this new live disc. The studio album concentrates on the songs, whereas ""Live at the Stone Coast Brewery"" is all about the jam and great improvisation. Each song packs a punch. There is great guitar and organ work throughout the album, backed by a grooving and very solid rhythm section. Highlights include a great extended vocal jam, too. Overall, this album is a must have for lovers of jam-rock, improvisation, or just all around fun music!"	1
"This overview of the trio's songs is excellent, although if you own the Motown Hits anthologies, you already own 75% of the songs. Has rare mono mixes of Freda Payne's ""Band Of Gold"" and the Chairmen Of The Board's ""Give Me Just A Little More Time."" Informative liners notes."	1
"and less pictures... seriously, this is great ...no, the best zombie fiction I have ever read, and close to as good as i could expect any to be. Stop pandering to Brian Keene and his awful, tripe, totally-out-of-touch ""Rising"" series and start reading these, you won't be sorry. The difference is as that between harlequin romance and The Master and Margarita..."	1
First of all, I have major issues with children's snacks that are so full of sodium.I have to admit, my son loves these. What is not so great is the two or three days of garlic breath I have to endure afterwards. Was it so necessary to add garlic salt to a toddler snack? The onion and other vegetables are more than enough to provide flavour.	0
the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice	1
"The Eurorack was purchased as a portable mixer to tie mics into a camera. The inherent noise in my particular mixer is completely unacceptable. At a very reasonable level using balanced connections the mixer unmistakably colors the sound with a clear sounding ""HISS"". Even when running on batteries and far away from any electronic device the HISS is incredibly loud! Totally unacceptable for my purpose. The unit is now stashed away in a closet, a washed up waste of time!However for those on a budget who desire much greater quality with fewer inputs I HIGHLY recommend a Mackie 402-VLZ3 Four-Channel Compact Audio Mixer. However sometimes fewer inputs are unacceptable. Whatever the case steer clear from behringer!"	0
I like these diapers and it's great to get so many at once, but we have had some blowouts up the back.	1
It's made cheaply both material and the workmanship. It's made of relatively soft metal like chrome colored brass. Bright side of this is it's easy to cut, so if the wheel of you bicycle goes way up high, you can cut it lower with a hack saw with relative ease, at least easier than cutting steel. It supports the weight of a bicycle pretty well but you can't sit on the bike while it's on the stand, of course. Even when I cranked the pedal to the full speed, it was stable to reasonable level. It could have been a better design with hollow aluminium(or good quality steel tube) and lighter and I would have happily paid the higher price for it. The bottom line is this. It's not the most refined looking stand but it works for its purpose and I recommend it to anyone who needs a simple portable bike stand for on location repair or adjustment.	1
"This book is rife with misconceptions about the Catholic Church and is a disappointing read for anyone with even the slightest understanding of marian apparitions. The suspense builds until finally, near the end of the book, the missing portion of the ""third secret of Fatima"" is revealed. The problem is that the missing portion of the secret is preposterous and unbelievable, making the climax of the book a disappointment.I am surprised that best-selling author Steve Berry would produce a book that is so poorly researched. He has lost credibility with me and I will never read another of his books.Beyond betraying the author's ignorance of the Catholic Church, the book was poorly edited and had many typos. At one point, the name of even one of the main characters was misspelled!While many would find the book's suspense compelling, I thought reading it was a waste of time."	0
The autobiography of Ben Franklin is a worthwhile read simply because of who Ben Franklin is. It is beneficial to understand the character of this great man by judging him through his own words. There is no doubt that Franklin was an ingenius man and his witty rhetoric further confirms his intelligence. It also confirms his egotistical nature I hate to say.... But I suppose he had every right given his success...Anyhow, I thought the first portion of the book (written before the revolution) was much more interesting that the latter half. Unfortunately the autobiography was never really finished by Franklin. He ends off abruptly during the French and Indian War period and there is nary an remark concerning American Independence, which would have been interesting to read about from his point of view.Still, overall, it's worth the read.	1
"This book would only be good for a marine biologist or a latin translator because they are the only people who can translate it. The book might say something like, ""The Nautilus was attacked by a group of spodulini auarius."" You then are confused. A few chapters later, it might say how the Nautilus was attacked by some giant squid. Then everything clicks. The story was long and winding, and seemed like it would never end. I couldn't finish the book as it had begun them to seem torturous. Don't read it."	0
I read and reported on this book for my Probability and Statistics class back in college. It permanently changed the way that I view and evaluate polls, ratings, and statistics that we are bombarded with on an almost daily basis. Innocculate yourself! Buy this book and master it- you won't be disappointed.	1
This is a great book, I could not put it down, I read it in two days then passed it on to my son. Once he is done I will read it again as a means of connecting with him. He is 18 years old and I want all of God's blessings that are in store for him! On the other hand I want him to be aware, so that when he faces his enemies, he will be well equipped to identify his battles! I also have a 16 year old son, and when the time is right I will have him read it as well. As an associate Pastor, and Leader of Our Church Men's Ministry, I will purchase several copies and then use it in a Bible study format. I HIGHLY recommend this book to young and old alike!	1
A fascinating look at Franklin's life in his own voice. It is unfortunate that he did not narrate the last 30 years of his life as well.	0
ALthough I'm not a huge Kristofferson fan, I heard a few tracks on the local FM station and decided to give this cd a try. (Thanks to the previous reviews here also).I'm glad I spent the $$$. The cd as a whole creates a mellow mood. The lyrics aren't over wrought by the performers. I think the producer did a wonderful job of maintaining an overall feel without restricting the artists own styles.There are a few tracks I'm not fond of (very subjective) but I know that I will listen to this cd many times over the next decade. With our ability to create our own playlists for ipods etc., I don't see the point in quibbling over a few tracks. How often are there 15/18 songs on a cd that you truly enjoy?	1
How come everyone constantly praises Shakespeare, Keats, Whitman, etc.? No one ever mentions any Eastern poets, i.e. Basho. I get more from 3 of his lines than pages of other poet's works. Don't get me wrong - I take nothing away from Whitman & this is excellent poetry.	1
"""Rollerball"" in theatres was an awesome, bone-crunching, action-packed movie! But once it got on video & DVD...they added in nudity & took out scenes. It was terrible. The camera work was even altered when it came on video. I wouldn't have mind if they at least put the theatrical version on video too... bet they didn't! WHAT HAPPENED WHEN THEY TRANFERED THE FILM?"	0
Jenny Teale is a secret penpal to Captain John Braithwaite while he was fighting in the first Iraqui war. Her letters are intimate and win his heart. When he returns stateside, however, she refuses to meet him.JR doesn't know that Jenny has been wounded both physically and emotionally when a disastrous auto accident left her serious injured and abandoned by her (now ex) husband.He's determined to find his ideal woman, she's equally determined to be anonymous and independent. The resulting story is a delight.	1
"I didn't care much for Clay on AI (or Ruben, for that matter), but I got the CD anyway since he has a really good voice. Well, there are a couple good songs on this CD, such as ""Invisible"", although some of the lyrics are weird (""if I was invisible then I could just watch you in your room""), ""No More Sad Songs"", and the chorus to ""I survived you"". Overall, though, I didn't really care for the CD. If you were a fan of him on the show, you'll definitely like this album."	0
Guys, where are the master tapes? This transfer was taken direct from vinyl. Ze is charging premium prices for this and you can hear surface noise throughout this cd. This wasn't even taken from a particularly clean copy of the vinyl!!!!!	0
This is a french book. French books are, of course, often french, but this one is frencher than most. Ah, Pierrot! Reading this fine french book makes me the sad clown of life. Could Voltaire be any frencher, you ask? I doubt it. I am a sad clown, I say. Even when he criticizes the French he does so in a, how do you say, french way. Oui, oui! So come, bring along your Jerry Lewis video tapes and we will read this very french book together. It is frencher than a Quebecer at a Steisand concert. Frencher than Little Richard at an amfAR banquet. Frencher than Richard Simmons at a french pride parade. Read Candide and you too can be a very french sad clown. Sacre Bleu!!!	0
I love this book. It is exciting and thrilling. I love the idea of people not being able to read books or think for them selfes. I think that this book should be read by all.	1
We have 2 year old twin boys and sometimes it's just hard to grab them to change them. We have not had any problems with leakage, even overnight! Our boys sleep 12 hours and these diapers last! Plus they are very thin before being put on so you can stash a large number of them in a diaper bag. About 1/2 as thin as the Target brand and buy buying at Amazon with the reoccurring shipments they are cheaper (per diaper) than the Kirkland (Costco) brand.	1
I recommend this book to everyone:children, young adults and adults. It is not only a page turner but a lesson teacher, too. The book is about a young adult named Kit who leaves her fancy home in Barbados to live with her aunt and uncle in Weathersfield,Conn. She is not only put on trial for a witch, but a man she does not care for picks her to marry him. Will she be hung for a witch or have to marry the man she dislikes. I am not going to tell you; you will have to find out for yourself.	1
"I have to admit that I am not a big fan of many of Adam Sandler's movies. I thought he was funny on ""Saturday Night Live"" but I find many of his movies dissappointing. Some I find just not good (""Zohan"") while others I find good for a while then they lose steam.(""Chuck & Larry"", ""Click"" ""Spanglish"") Most of his movies I'll find some funny or amusing bits but not enough to sustain a whole movie. I keep watching Sandler movies and finally I've found one that is very good from start to finish.""50 First Dates""_is a very good movie with a clever premise, a good script and a good supporting cast, especially leading lady Drew Barrymore. I've liked some of his other films (""Big Daddy"" ""Bedtime Stories"") but not as much as this one. It shows that given a good script, Sandler can make good movies. A very solid 4 stars here."	1
This is a great movie. All at once, I saw that, yes, Brendan Fraser does deserve to be in a movie with McKellan and Redgrave. This movie is tender, beautiful, and crack-me-up funny--all at the same time. The photography is excellent. Script--wonderful. SEE THIS MOVIE!!!	1
Before you buy this, measure out 20 oz because it was way smaller than I thought it would be. Also, after washing this a few times, it developed a small spot of rust where the handle attaches to the pitcher. I thought stainless steel did not rust so I returned the pitcher.	0
I used a USB adapter before this, but the connection kept getting disconected. Now with the TiVo adapter, I never loose the connection and get to enjoy my TiVo alot more.	1
I enjoyed this book very much. Saw a lot of myself in the pages. Some good and some bad, I think all females should read as rite of passage. Will enlighten and encourage a different behavior. A book that should be read and passed on to others.	1
This film is amazing... not only is the cinematography masterfully done, but also the many layers of the entire film. I especially love it on DVD because I can hear the director and Franka's opinions about the film. Also, wide screen... need I say more?	1
I read the foundation books and was reminded why I don't like asimov. The man has Phd's in chemistry and a gazillion other physical sciences and he likes to show it off. And that makes it very hard for us lay scifi geeks.	0
This Antenna works better as a non powered antenna then a powered. I had to return mine after a few times moving it around the crimp on the wire gave out and it feel apart. there are better cheaper Antenna you are not getting what you are paying for.	0
This is a huge disappointment for my family, and has forever left a stain on the memory of my son's recent birthday. This piece of garbage cannot, does not, and will not stand up. And it does not stay together. And the elevator breaks easily. And some of the figures don't fit in the elevator.So there it lies, in pieces, in the corner. And here I lie, curled in a ball in the other corner, wondering if I am an inadequate father because I can't make a $40 piece of crap stand up.I hope whoever designed this goes back to creating torture devices.	0
I have purchased all the Perry Mason TV series, 1 through 6, through Amazon. I have not been disappointed with any of the series. Looking forward to season Seven.	1
I really don't know.Just finished re-reading it again, and still cried in parts, and was still left with a broad smile at the very end. (Like other readers, my paperback versions no longer have covers, and even this hardback is getting beaten up)The only disappointing part is that he isn't still writing in this universe.I asked him about it when I saw him at a convention in Denver a few years ago, and he said that this universe was pretty tied up at a good stopping point, and that he has so many other projects that he is less likely to go back to it. (I'm paraphasing).That is truly disappointing, because although I love most of his other books (I stopped reading Honor at about 12), this is his best work.Oh well...I only have to wait 5 more months for the next Merlin book.	1
I was very dissapointed with the quality of this video. During the entire video, you could see the woman reading the cards behind the camera. The ladies did not teach any moves that you could not just make up on your own.	0

I've read them all, many times over and am a big fan. This one held so much promise for me, describing the culture and life of the Californios. And then he had to inject that mystic story of another world in there.....	0

This is one of the best Argento Movies ever. The music though simple stays with you. There are few plot holes unlike most Agrento Moives. The ending is a definite twist! I hope Troma releases the UNCUT version of Stendhal Syndrome because there really is no place to cut the movie without losing some of the impact and Plot points	1
This product works exactly as advertised. Click the button and find out what the song is. The website isn't set up very well, and it's slow because of all the annoying flash stuff, but with broadband it's definitely usable.Unfortunately, it's only usable for the rest of September. Emarker.com is shutting down, and that makes the eMarker useless. Thus, the 1-star review. Current users are being offered a refund, but my guess is if you buy one now you won't get that.I'd write more detail, but I have to go print hardcopies of my eMarks. :(	0
What can I say? I love this cd because it has all my favorite songs from sweat & suit on one cd. I don't have to take one cd out to hear songs from the other cd. Plus i love the fact it has my favorite song on there with Murphy Lee (he needs to drop a new cd) River Don't Runnn. I love the new single Grillz. Way to go Nelly.	1
This is not one of Daignault's better books, it reads like some poorly written nostalgic ego trip, with way too many paragraphs about beating out the regulations on beach buggy laws and surf casting that were put in place in the Cape in the 1970s. The title does certainly does not belie its contents: you indeed feel like it's been 20 years of Daignault on the Cape by the time you're finished reading it.	0
This thing arrived five days before the original estimated delivery date and even one day before the Fed-Ex date. Rolled nicely in the box without folds or crunching that would cause roll marks in the nap. Fits great on the dash in my 96 Camaro. The only thing to mention would be that where the dash drops to the right of the instrument panel the binding sticks out slightly further than anywhere else. Could only be on my particular piece, as I do not know if they are bound individually or machine run. Overall a great buy and worth every penny. I purchased this because my main dash plastic has several cracks and the dash mat was less than half the price of a new main dash panel and of course, less work. Best improvement to the car to date!	1
I have tried similar products in the past, but wasn't very satisfied. After reading the excellent reviews for this one, i gave it a try. I am disappointed. Even though it comes in precut shapes and is cold wax, it did not do a very good job on my eybrows. It left a lot of hairs. The shape of the precut wax strips isn't very good neither - it didn't match my eybrows very well. My conclusion so far from my experience with at home wax products is that nothing does as good of a job as you get in a salon.	0
people should buy headsets to fit these things bc they are so essential..A must have for any headset that will fit them	1
Definitely one of the few books that give you the feeling that life is just worth living. Once you realize what is 'ultimate catastrophe' or 'the one unforgivable sin', you will see life differently. If you have seen the film and listened to the music, go forward and read the book	1
this film is one of my all time favorites but i have to say the picture quality of the video is very poor i am needless to say dissapointed	0
Does little more then scratch the surface in most areas.Would only be of any use for the novice.Ken	0
This is one of my favourite Jewish Choral CDs of all time yet I agree with other reviewers that this is not representative of the Jewish choral tradition of the UK. This should have been a double CD set with the first featuring really traditional music and the second exposing us to the new genre of mainly modern Reform choral and organ music.Both Moshe and the choir excel themselves. The master mixing is not good and one can hear obvious retakes and splits in the music which is unfortunate. I've not idea what Oseh Shalom by Nurit Hirsh is doing on the CD!The music of the modern mainly reform composers Lipkin, Josephs, Singer is wonderful. If I had to choose three pieces to take to a desert island, I would take Ma Yedidot by Charles Salaman, Aneh Ani by Verrinder and Psalm 23 by Rideout. Three magnificent works.I believe the company, Olympia, no longer functions so there won't be many more CDs available. If it's still available, grab one!	1
"When I first put this DVD in I noticed that they cut away the opening, then the movie starts and I can't believe my eyes as the quality of the DVD is even lower than my VCD version, this is just frustrating to watch. The subtitle cannot be change or removed since it is fixed onto the movie, the subtitle is in chinese and english use at the same time, the quality of the image is so below par that the subtitle at times can't even be read. Another thing is the audio, you can't switch between Cantonese and Mandarin like on my VCD, yes this too was fixed to cantonese only. There is no extra features, you might as well buy a VHS tape, which would probably be an improvement on the picture quality. It does look like they tranfer this movie from an overused VHS tape with no other intention then to sell it to unsuspecting ""customers""(read victims)."	0
"If you teach Introduction to Philosophy using a historical approach, this is the text I recommend. I used ""The Philosophic Classics 2nd edition, From Plato to Nietzsche"" for my classes and was looking for a text with the same basic works with some more contemporary materials. I find the updated 3rd edition, ""From Plato to Derrida"" the perfect solution. Instead of having to look through more textbooks for the right stuff, this is it."	1
I bought this product because I'm living temporarily in a city and will move to another city later, and don't have the extra money to buy a better bed. Since then my shoulders hurt from sleeping on it. I've lost interested in sleeping after that. Before that i never have problems with sleeping.It's ok to sleep for one or two nights only i guess. If you intend to sleep on it for a few months, buy a comfy bed instead of this!	0
If you like the Parallels cd, then you will probably like this one too. Inside Out contains songs that, I think, could have easily been included on the Parallels disc, released three years previous. The production on this disc is kind of lacking in bass and depth, but the songs are just as beautiful as those on Parallels.	1
I could sense the heart pumping excitement builds up every time my 4 year old play this game. He knows 1 mistake and the crocodile will grab his little fingers. You play it by pushing down 1 tooth of the croc for each person's turn. Each time you set the game, the tooth that will make the mouth closes is selected at random. The croc's mouth closes but is not that hard enough to hurt their fingers. 2 or more players. Does not require batteries to operate.I have seen this toy for years, it is a classic. This is a great toy in a dentist's waiting area.	1
I got this as a free selection. It was so incredibly boring and I could not finish it. Don't waste any amount of money on it.	0
"I bought this mattress as a spare guest bed for our vacation condo. I was delighted to see it described as being 80""x40""(a twinXL). It arrived and the box clearly stated 80x40 dimensions so put it in the closet for future use. Just pulled it out of the closet 3months late and inflated the mattress only to find it is a standard twin measuring 32""x72"". Nothing close to the stated dimensions noted in the product description and on the box."	0
Every time I watch this movie, it makes me 'feel GOOD'! It proves that LOVE will find a way (although sometimes it takes a genius to figure out what that way will be).I loved the romantic parts of this movie, especially the idea of the 'first kiss' which Drew Barrymore got to experience over and over because of her short term memory problem.It could have been better without the crude humor but the relationship between Adam Sandler's character and Drew Barrymore's charactor is reason enough to watch this movie.The ending never fails to give me chills..it's heartwarming and terrific!	1
Works fine. Easy to install. Some reviews talk about not fitting wall plates. Designed for the plate supplied to fit over the existing plate so plate supplied is over sized for a reason.	1
Follow John Carter's son Carthoris on his first adventure in the series. It was a quick read for me that left me looking forward to the next book.	1
I've used lots of lip and cheek stains that have had a great result, and unfortunately this is not one of them. I gave it two stars because of the price: you are getting what you pay for. The texture is really waxy and I not as natural looking as other products. It did look okay when I first put it on, but it doesn't blend incredibly well, and rubs off within a couple hours. I'd spend some more money and get something a bit higher quality.	0
I simply cannot understand why everyone is gushing praise on such a poorly written piece of patriotic blather. Is it that you can readily identify with the author when you plop down on the couch to watch the Nightly News? The rambling, disconnected content of this book left me wanting a refund. I am a proud American, and one who has studied this period of time quite extensively, and this definitely WAS the Greatest Generation indeed! This book, I fear, is going to lead to a host of copycat writings by those who will use their celebrity exposure to command a princely sum for a cliche-ridden hack job of a novel. Enough already!	0
This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written.	0
Programming is like sex. One mistake and you have to support it for the rest of your life.	1
I thought this movie was one of those horror movies that took forever to get to the point!!!It reminded me of Wolf Creek which I barely watched. These movies make you want something to happen so bad that u almost turn the movie off. Finally when it did get to the good parts they were pretty good. I wish the story line could have figured out a different way to find these creatures instead of showing flashbacks of people cheating with other women's husbands before he died and Blah Blah Blah Blah Blah. Different storyline, same characters. Might have then been awesome!	0
If you're getting a lovebird or 2 for a pet this is a great book. It goes over feeding, health, and all the other things a bird would need. It doesnt talk about breeding though. It goes over the different species which is nice.. The reason I gave it 4 stars was because it didn't talk about breeding. But as a pet book, it should be 5 starts :)	1
Ok. So Isabelle Huppert was brave in doing some of the things she does in this. So what?The movie is a pretentious bore which never grabs the viewer. It's just a series of nasty and kinky scenes which ultimately go nowhere. The Isabelle Huppert character is a psychopath, but incredibly she is an uninteresting one.A truly disappointing movie.	0
"The warmers don't keep fluid warm. I read my comments and in trying to be humorous i became inarticulate. As you can see. I purchased three of Mr. Coffee mug warmers. As one of the last of the big spenders I expected to keep coffee warmer than tepid. I know that burning houses down is not good for the Mr. Coffee image but in ""She Who must be obeyed's"" dressing room, She who rules, bedside cabinet and subserviant he, lukewarm isn't what we wanted - so she tells me. I intend to try one of another brand and see if there is a difference. Want to buy nearly unused coffee warmers - well known brand?Is this the hyper link? [...]"	0
this is the worst comedy evericould tell this was an adam sandler movie right from the startit its a compilation of all the weak jokes from his past movies and albums, actors and songs put together to make a very dissapointing comedy. Had i known this movie was so bad, i hoped someone would have brought it TO MY ATTENTION YESTERDAY!!!!	0
I was looking for a book about the shop space itself, and this was right on the money. There one chapter on general tools that one would need, but that's it. The rest is dedicated to preparing a space for a woodshop. There is a lot of attention paid to outbuilding-type 'dream' shops most of us will never have, but electricity, surface treatment, storage, etc. are all still applicable. Every chapter is a reference itself. The table of contents is clear and makes it easy to find what you may be interested in.	1
"This is a fun movie if you like the romantic comedy.Why 1 star?? There is a scene where an old woman calls ayoung German couple ""facists"". The irony is, the old lady is Italian. Whoever wrote the scene doesn't own I history book Iguess. That's a little on the predjudice side for me and it didn't belong in a comedy. I'm glad the couple weren't African-American, I wonder what she would have called them.Don't support this garbage by buying it, loan it from your library."	0
When i got my package i openned it and everything was great, but the sand holder is so cheaply made, it was broken before i even touched it. Now i have to go through the hassle of finding the right one maybe at a home goods store.. and there is no way you can have a refund which i wanted, because they take off the sticker you use to send it back. I basically paid for sand rocks, and a cheap rake. Not worth the money! Made in china, the table is not stable at all. I hope nobody buys this, because they certainly dont deserve the money. Quality over quantity. -Rant over-	0
Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf	0
totally awesome, this show is great, season three is kinda short though, only like 10 episodes at 10 minutes each, so not too long, but still halarious and unique.	1
Except for a very small portion toward the end of the book, I thought the rest was just plain BORING and struggled to get through it. I was really hoping to like this series but have been extremely disappointed after all the great reviews and comparisons to Gabaldon.	0
I purchased this CD for a college assignment on the war generation. I picked a perfect book. Tom Brokaw truly captures an entire generation with detailed accounts of their heroic challenges they faced. I believe that the only downfall to this book is Tom Brokaw's voice. As nice as it sound on TV doing the news, it seems to be a bit monotone. It started to drive me nuts several times while listening. I guess that's why I chose to purchase the book on CD so I could just stop it at any time and then pick it back up an hour or two later. Overall, it is well worth the money.	1
This is the worst programming textbook I have yet seen. It requires the student to read each chapter from start to finish, because one cannot just go to a subject of interest and learn it. The writing style is completely in-line. I found I had to re-read sections many times to ascertain what the authors were trying to say, and the code examples were not self-contained. While I am not a programmer by training, I have taken a course in Java and many other courses. This book also focused too much on databases to my taste, but others may find that emphasis useful. Even the teacher who selected it said he made a mistake.	0
"I bought ""Heritage of the Star"" (UK title) when I was 11, more or less at random from the Puffin Book Club, and it remained my favourite book for years and was lent to everyone I know. It was one of the first science fiction books I had ever read that made me THINK (and wasn't just Boys Stuff in Space), and its outcome surprised and amazed me. It had never occurred to me that there could be sequels, so I was delighted to find this trilogy at Amazon and finally read the rest of the story. Science (and Science Fiction) may have moved on, but this remains one of the best stories for teenagers (and everyone else) I've ever read; it deserves a much higher profile - buy it for yourself and every young person you know who likes to daydream and think about the bigger things in life."	1
Checked this sad excuse for a book out at the library -- glad I didn't pay for it. Stay at home moms unite in our insecurities -- that is these authors' message loud and clear. (Hello, Dr. Laura is known for this muck, yet where is her family?) Ever notice the lack of books written by working moms who criticize stay at home moms? They're generally too busy applying themselves to better pursuits.I'm a part-time working mom who is proud to set an example for my daughter. She won't be anyone's handmaiden in life. We should all have higher hopes for our daughters. They can and should do BOTH.	0
I've always had a warmer on my desk and in my family room. But finally one died. I didn't really like them because you had to use a tapered cup, as a full size mug wouldn't fit on it. I bought a pair of these on chance and I'm glad I did. They keep your coffee, tea, or other hot beverage hot. It won't heat them up, but will keep them hot/ warm enough to drink. And, not too hot that it makes your coffee bitter. And, you can use a regular mug, it'll fit. I highly recommend this.	1
This book is set up as a dictionary. If you enjoy reading dictionaries, then please purchase this book. The humor was lost on me because of the format.	0

"This is one of the best works by german group SCOOTER. The album starts with an deep intro and suddenly kicks off with its best track "" How much is da fish.."". ""Call me manana"", similiar to that, follows up shortly. I personally enjoy song No.10 "" Everything is borrowed"", great example of transe techno. CD's is definitely worth buying, it will be a great addition to a your DJ collection."	1
The book starts well( first 20 pages). However, the writing switches from overloaded sentences, to very basic prose all over the place. The author leaves you wondering why the relationship betwen Marc and Uva is so strong.Why does Marc go in search for her. Would not a foreigner taht has been attacked leave the country? And then magicaly Uva appears in the last chapter out of nowhere.Do not waste your time reading this novel.	0
This could have been a good book but the writer puts in child rape which is gross and doesn't have the couple together enough. Teh war is used to take up space and the romance with the slave couple was more believable. Not enough passion and does not cover the war very well	0
I just loved this movie - I have seen this so many times and still find myself completely in love with Nicholas Cage and his tormented, passionate demeanor in this flick. He and Cher light up the screen and you find yourself wanting more at the end. Another hopeless romantic film that you just can't get enough of.	1
Our class had to read this book as part of the curriculum... and I am so glad we did! This classic deserves the attention it has gotten the past (almost) 100 years! Read this book!Of Mice and Men is about a retarded man named Lennie and the man who travels and protects him, George, and their journey to work on a ranch during the Great Depression.All of the characters in this book were complex and marvelous... even the ones who had less than 5 lines!George- The man who gave up his happiness to help and love Lennie.Lennie- A strong man with the mind of a toddler. He will do anything to make George happy.Curley- He hates Lennie because he is intimidated by men who are bigger than him.Curley's Wife- She flirts with every man on the ranch to make up for the loneliness Curley gives her.This book was written amazingly... obviously, it's a classic! Even though it was written in the early 20th century, it is easy to comprehend if you are at least 12.	1
"This is the 11th book in the delightful Agatha Raisin series. Ideally, the books should be read in sequence, starting with the first and my favorite, Agatha Raisin and the Quiche of Death. These books are light reading and a pleasant way to spend an afternoon or evening. At the title implies, Agatha and her new husband, James, discover that their marriage was a mistake. James then disappears after being attacked and is also suspected of murdering his rumored mistress, Melissa. Agatha, ever the amateur sleuth, is anxious to solve the crime and also clear her husband's name. She sets off with her old friend, Sir Charles, to do both. In addition to amateur sleuthing in the quaint villages around the Cotswolds, Agatha is grappling with getting older and feels ""the autumn of her life stretching in front of her."" We will have to wait for book #12 to find out how Agatha is coping with being single again."	1
"If you are researching illumination of Spanish Codex and manuscripts this is the book to have. There are only two books written in English that cover this unique style; the other book on Spanish medieval illumination is:Early Spanish Manuscript Illumination. The quantity and quality of the pictures in ""The Illuminated Manuscripts..."" make the price worth it. Spanish 10-11th century illumination is quite separate and unique from the rest of Europe using lively imagery, repeating patterns and vivid color combinations. This book captures the spirit of Spanish medieval artwork and shows the world the finest examples of this form."	1
"Dolly has described this CD as her ""Blue Mountain"" CD. Part Bluegrass, part mountain music. This is as good as it gets. Dolly never fails to deliver and if you are a Dolly fan or a fan of good music in general, you will not be disappointed."	1
"When I heard their first album, leitmotif, I was blown away (something that only ocassionally happens). A fascinating album, combining various instrumentals with well placed vocals. so some time went by and eventually I bought the follow up, el ceilo (sp), and to say the least it was really damn disappointing. songs were too structured, ambiant sounds were predictable and not-interesting. and the lyrics SUCKED. i was really bummed. but then I saw a new album comming out. alright, perhaps they learned from mistakes, perhaps every song won't sound over-produced and catchy. instead, it only got worse. if you had never heard this band before, ""catch without arms"" will probably sound alright. but if you knew how good they were on leifmotif, don't buy this. i feel like i wasted my money (and i rarely feel that way about music). dredg has lost whatever it was they had. they are just mediocre. a real tragedy"	0
An amazing movie, not as fast and furious as people would have you believe, but breathtaking and suspenseful. Franka Potente is absolutely hypnotizing as Lola and the overall feel of the movie is romantic and fun. The dvd includes some fun extras, like Franka Potente's music video 'I Believe' and audio commentary by Franka and the director. Although translation is cumbersome sometimes, I would definately recommend the subtitled version over the dubbed(both are included on the dvd). In a word, astounding!	1
i read a few articles about it not being as advertised i cant speak for those rtards but all 3 were the unrated version very cheap its a good thing! 3 dvds one box and tim tebow sucks!	1
but I had to make the time to finish the book to make sure that I wasn't missing anything. At times I felt there was something else that needed to be said to complete the story. Maybe for me, the author should have started with some background, instead of when the character cut off her hair, and then after she cut her hair she should have made her proud and not afraid of what others had to say about her, this should have been about her feelings and only about her feelings about her hair.	1
This was an excellent historical work on modern Pagan Witchcraft. It does tend to focus on Wicca, but it does also talk about Druids, and non-Gardnarian Traditions. If you know nothing about Wicca, I recomend you start with another book, or the very last chapter serves as an excelent summary of what Wiccans belive, and though it seams weird to suggest it, you might want to read the last chapter first. Although the author is a historian and not a Pagan or a Witch, he remains respectful in his historical endevor. This book is an excelent example of how a new religion is born, and perhapse the only such history of the birth of a new faith to exist!	1
8 volumes of christian principles that have guided our lives in today's modern world. You will be amazed with the wealth of information, leadership, guidance that these 8 volumes provide. A must for anyone to read or have as a research source.	1
Not as described, the material is cheap looking and does not feel soft on the skin. Was dissapointed of the quality and packaging.	0
Every night we put our 1 year old in one of these diapers, and most mornings he wakes up not just leaky, but with the seams of the diaper opened up and the absorbent material all over his clothes and skin! But since we bought so many we have had to keep using them and dealing with this disgusting problem day after day.They are fine during the day, when we change him fairly often. But during the 12 hour night time they are useless. Huggies leak too, but at least they don't explode.	0
When I received this in the mail it didn't work. Upon further inspection, it looks like FansEdge sent me an already defective product because the product had batteries in it already, which it was not supposed to come with. I called them and they were supposed to send me a return label to send the product back and a refund. I am still waiting 3 weeks later for both of these and now have to work with my credit card company to contest payment. I would not order anything from FansEdge again.	0
I tend to purchase DVD's that star actors whom I admire and whose work I enjoy watching. Bill Nighy, McAvoy, Morrissey are but a few of them and do not disappoint. This miniseries is loaded with formidable British actors. The suspense is electric and the characterizations are crisp and often malevolent, which British espionage thrillers do so well. I highly recommend this one.	1
Nice exhaust System especially for the price, but my stupid son decided he didn't like it after about a year and ripped it out and put up a cherry bomb held up by a coat hanger. He said it was rattling on the rear, but his jeep has a tank skid guard that affects the fit. He also said that one of the mounts rusted off, but he has taken his Cherokee four wheeling a lot and I think the hard bouncing and bumps may affect the durability on the tailpipe.	1
I bought this because I am a bit introverted and the idea of sitting in a room with other couples was causing me anxiety. But, my midwife really wanted me to get the wealth of knowledge that a child birth class provides. I took a chance and found this DVD on amazon. I truly lucked out, this dvd is awesome! The teacher is qualified and just funny. She keeps you interested and gives the info in easy to remember ways. I like that there are five couples in the class, so you still get the worries and questions that other new parents could only provide. The interaction is great and you can stop and start the dvd at you convenience. I will say that it held my interest so much that I watched the entire first dvd without stopping! If going to a an actual class is not for you for whatever reason, then I would highly recommend this to you! You will not regret it and will come out more knowledgeable and feeling confident about your upcoming birth. Good Luck!!!	1
"I searched hi and low for a desk that would work in my son's small room -- I wanted a desk made of wood and available in honey finish to match his other furniture with a small hutch (as a large hutch wouldn't work)...and at a reasonable price. The Kidcraft Avalon Desk is perfect! I took off one star because I didn't realize how short it was - ok for my 9 yr old son now, but as he grows up I'm afraid he will outgrow the desk. It would be great if Kidcraft offered taller replacement legs so that the desk could be raised higher as your child grows. I feel the desk is sturdy enough to go off with my child to college if were not for the short height! Dear Kidcraft...please make taller replacement legs so that the desk can be ""normal"" desk height for later years, making is a ""Teen""kraft desk ;-). Thanks."	1
"Although this album breaks no new ground, it does bring back some great memories. Memories of the early Ramones, when Dee Dee wrote his best songs. Hop Around is much better that his last album, with several excellent songs, many good ones, and only a couple of throw-aways. Dee Dee borrows many of his own riffs and song titles, but I guess it's OK to steal from yourself. ""I Don't Wanna Die in The Basement,"" ""Now I Wanna Be Sedated,"" and ""38th & 8th"" may not be the most original songs, but they are great nonetheless. Also, the production is very good. Any Ramones fan should definitely buy this album. Others are advised to buy it and see how the ""old school"" rocks."	1
I love this movie! It is a tender and funny movie. Rosalind Russell (Mrs. Jacoby) shares her jewish traditions with a Japanese gentleman while in Japan. It is about how racism can be overcome by gentle understanding. How graceful times were. Truly a gem!	1
I have read all the reviews, before, and again after, since my unit crapped out...It lasted 6 months, light use. The signal went out via a audio mixer with 3 pairs of ceiling speakers, never used all at once, maybe two pair, and it just crapped out after 6 months. The fuse wasn't blown, the lights still came on, it just stopped working. I had my doubts on a $100 unit before hand and ummm and my doubts came true. I am looking at other brands now.	0
Beware: contrary to the item description above, this volume is not organized thematically; it does not contain any section.	0
This book is a very informative, yet easy read about the realities of life and how patterns are repeated sometimes even unknowingly until honestly addressed and changed. That is where the power of this book lies in giving insight, tools, all with a touch of humor to make positive changes of direction in our lives. Highly recommend.	1
they don't tell you different heights need different sizes.... til you have to pay over half the price to return it! BE CAREFUL... they aren't... very disappointing!	0
I loved this book and the way Torey Hayden treats these special children. I have read all of her books and liked every one.She just have been put on this earth for what she does for these children. Excellent writing.	1
"I borrowed this DVD from my local library, I was taken a back with the quality of this DVD, it looks like a crap video that is a shambles, The audio is reasonable in 5.1 plus the Doco is just ok, but the concert must be the worst vision I have seen on a DVD, How can David Bowie be happy with this visual display of inferior quality?, I get cheesed off with having good AV gear to have to run this type of crap, and that's what it is, CRAP!! I have videos that come up 100% better, Why produce DVDs that dont qualify for this technology? it""s not the first and it won't be the last, DVD producers please don't bother putting visual crap out on DVD, your transfers are unworthy of modern technology, if the Masters don't scrub up for transfer forget it, although a lot of people cant see any difference, so be it."	0
This is a great book for young musicians for inspiration. It tells a brief story in an easy to read format for each musician for a variety of instruments. Good for those who have the potential to go professional.	1
"This movie is atrocious!! It took away several (or at least FELT like several) hours of my life that I will never ever get back. I really am a Morrissey fan, but this movie makes a mockery of all things Moz - and not in a good way.Don't waste your time with this one. Honestly, the only individuals who might moderately enjoy this film are family members & close friends of those involved in the making of it. The writing is bad & the ""acting"" is even worse. Don't waste your time. I can't say it enough! It's an embarrassment and just AWFUL in every sense of the word. Don't waste your time - SERIOUSLY! I took one for the team on this one. Save yourself!!!"	0
Insert the CD and listen to the first track. This is everything Nightwish is known for. Any fan will love this album	1
This Sony VCT-TK1 is by far the best pocket tripod for instant use. I take it out of my pocket, screw on my camcorder, and it is ready to instantly take videos or self pictures.(Incidently, I have a wide variety of other different pocket-type tripods with three small legs and adjustable ball pan and tilt, but I do not use them.)	1
I've seen this on trunklids, with bikes or without: appears sturdy and appropriate. Fine.As for use at the back of a wagon, specifically an Outback, it simply doesn't fit. The side straps don't grab at a good angle because of the interior plastic connected to the hatch. The top straps can't get an easy grab on the metal (even with recommended $20 extra) without bending and threatening to break the back-up light assembly which are positioned above the rear glass.If you have an Outback, go for a roof rack solution, or spend the $ on a trailer hitch, I suppose.	0
"Although ""Run, Lola, Run"" is off-beat, has some nice camera work and a few impressive images, I could not develop any interest in any of the characters. Lola's extreme red hair and goofy outfit (blue tank top, white bra straps, turquoise pants, and black Doc Martin boots of all things) were distracting. The ""driving music beat"" (or however it was described), was fairly boring and repetitive.The commentary was only slightly more interesting than the movie. The two participants of writer/director Tom and lead actress Franka were a couple at the time, which accounts for the mutual admiration society feel of the commentary.There may have been a good idea for a movie here, but I could not find it. Close to being the least watchable movie (""Lost and Delirious"", ""The Smokers"", ""Black and White"" and ""Armageddon""). I nearly dozed off both times.I give the movie two stars for effort and concept, but I advise you to...""Run Away, Run"""	0
You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.	0
Deadly China Hero is a poorly edited version of the original Last Hero in China. I'm glad so many people like it but it lacks about 15 minutes of the original movie and they are the minutes that make it a cohesive movie instead of a jumble of martial arts fights. This taking of a classic martial arts movie, chopping it up, and then releasing it under a different name has got to stop! People deserve the chance to see the original movies!	0
This dvd was very helpful before I had my first baby. I wanted to be aware of the different things to do and what my husband should expect and it gave lots of information. loved it!	1
"Just a great item. However there are approximately 5 length-wise seams on the bottom to create stability. After two months, one seam ""disappeared, and now the bed rocks, because there is one large air space.I can probably live with it, just have to put some towels, whatever to stabilize it."	0
Good movie fun and entertaining. Lots of fun if your into the simple comedy.	1
I love Converse and this is my ninth pair. Not of the shoe of the same color though. I'm fairly meticulous about taking care of my shoes so all of the ones I own (some for more than 5 years!) still look brand new with moderate wear. They're comfartable, durable, versatile, and flat out cool. Go buy them if you've never owned a pair!	1
Christmas is about more than santa and presents. It's more than just the biggest tree with the best decorations. It's about a babe in a manger, three wise men and eternal salvation. In an innocent way only Charles Shultz and the crew can do, Charlie Brown (And Linus, et al) deliver this message loud and clear. I say everyone needs to buy this DVD before everything related to God and Jesus and the true meaning of Christmas is removed from the world... It's sad when a cartoon such as this may very well be one of the last strongholds Christians have on our own identity.My own personal soapbox aside, this movie is great. It's timely, even today. It's meaningful and it's truth personified. It teaches about the things that really matter in life, not the superficial garbage most people tend to worry about during the holidays.God Bless Charlie Brown!	1
In my opinion this is a strictly budget minded seat purchase.The seat springs make squeaky crunching noises as they compress when I ride it.Gave it to a homeless bicyclist.	0
This is would have to be without doubt one of the best live concerts on DVD. Buy it, put it on and turn it up full blast. You won't be disappointed, I assure you.	1
"What a shame that these are considered to be"" acclaimed films""..while the color,design,etc was fine-I was. Surprised that these fine actors would choose to act in such features.To be honest,I must admit. That I was unable to bring myself to finish viewing them all,it went from bad to worse"	0
I am frustrated by the sloppiness of this book. From what I understand, Bradbury sat in a library and wrote it in a few weeks, and it shows. Montag is introduced as a man happy in his job. The meeting with Clarisse blows his mind! But then Bradbury throws in numerous details indicating that his dissatisfaction has been mounting for some time. Although Montag is purportedly of a divided mind, the development of his character is very abrupt and unconvincing. But why develop what is essentially a mouthpiece for your own ranting? Blech. Bradbury's ideas have come to fruition in our time, but, ironically, his own work is not literature at all. I do not understand why this work is lauded as a classic.	0
Sure, this generation won a war, but what was the alternative?In my opinion, all this generation did was run up the world's greatest debt...then leave it to their kids to pay the tab.When they didn't have a war to send their children to, they created one in Vietnam. After killing over 50,000 of us, they decided maybe it wasn't such a good idea afterall.When they decided they didn't want to pay for their own medical bills, they created Medicare. And guess who pays? They underfunded their retirement. And guess who pays? They built a highway system. And guess who pays? They poluted the environment like never before. Guess who pays to clean it up the mess.I do agree with Brokaw on one point, this is one generation that was the greatest at one thing...avoiding responsibility.	0
The book is boring if you try to read it without a good look at the movie first but it gets easier to understand once youre in class failing every single test your teacher gives you on it! Then she decides to explain what's going on to you later. It was boring and I fell asleep everytime I went to read it.	0
We got this printer last year and have really liked it because it works pretty fast and we wanted something to print just text so we wouldn't have to keep replacing inkjet carts. We also got aNETGEAR PS121 USB 2.0 Mini Print Serverand it has all worked on our home network pretty well together, including with a PC that runs Win 98se (which had, much to my suprise, a usb port which was mandatory to set up the print server).	1
I had to read this book for my english teacher at my high school. I finished the book 3 weeks late, and the only reason I read it in the first place was because my teacher said read it or fail. Looking back I wish I would have just taken the zero, cause I failed anyway. If you have the choice for God's sake take the 0. They should re-name this book Retard on a Ranch.	0
A certain mental maturity is needed to appreciate this book. It is useless to prescribe it to silly bobby-socksers whose minds and interests can't go beyond TV shows about spoiled teenagers and/or Most-Popular-Boy-on-Whatyamacallit-School-Team. Go back to your Barbies, nitwits: you'll never be able TO READ.	1
"Had this one on vinyl back then. These girls know what rock and roll is! This IS HEART at their best [in the 80's].Not only the 5 singles on this album make it awesome but, the other songs are very good! I can tell by other critics that they must expect perfection consistently. Well man, it's ROCK AND ROLL and it's ""HEART"". Just one of the best in the business! They need NO critics! My opinion is that this album ROCKS! It's one of the girls best. LOVE YA GIRLS!ROCK ON! P.S. CAN'T GO WRONG HERE."	1
Yeah, Oasis defined a period with Wonderwall, and yeah they had a few good tunes on the first two albums. But haven't you all noticed you can play Wonderwall and Live Forever directly over all of these tracks? I give'em 2 for being consistent.	0
I'm a cotton man through and through. The elastic waist-ban has cotton woven into it and so far is proving to be very comfortable. We will see how well this cotton in the ban holds up through the months of wear and washing(I really don't like nylon touching my skin). Its been about 4-5 weeks and so-far so-good.	1
Had used the swaddlers for my baby till size 3 after which I switched to baby dry and have been extremely pleased with the product.....very absorbant without any leaks.	1
SOAD are so skilled and crafted in originality that they make hybrid metal and punk with a poiniant attack on politics have a new and resounding vessal.Unattainably superb the sounds this band makes are all their own. Try your best you will never begin to mistake them for another band.The title of my review only states that while being unlike thier first album this album still rocks so greatly. I myself also liked thier first album more but the highlights of this album even up and make me scream thier words in my car as I drive.I'd love to thank Serj and the boys for making such awesome and innovative music. Bless you guys!	1
So excited to get this.. but have tried and tried to get the white stopper to stay where it should. Others have tried as well, but no luck it keeps slipping out. Now maybe I am doing something wrong, but when something which seems simple takes so much energy time and effort, well something is wrong with the product. I have not had the joy of using it yet as it does look strong and of good quality. Sigh.	0
The story kept me turning pages. Ms. Austin brings the Old Testament to life and gave insight to what can sometimes be overlooked passages. I found myself anxious for Hezikiah's life and his return to Yahweh. I can't wait to read the remaining books in the series.	1
So the consensus is thumbs down.But, even though this isn't MacDonald's best, and even though there are indeed strong--I would say uncharacteristic--elements of misogynism in some of what Travis does to a particular woman for detective purposes, and even though the antagonist is so psychotically evil as to be unlikely to have survived past his teen years (much less prospered as a super-rich international corporate executive), and even though some of the McGee cultural observations seem pedestrian and heavy handed, it's still John D. MacDonald and Travis McGee.As one of the reviewers remarks, it may not be one of MacDonald's best--perhaps his teenage kids were acting up or protesting the war in Vietnam and his wife was verbally abusing him in that timeframe (1971)--but it is certainly memorable....For my complete review of this book and for other book and moviereviews, please visit my site [...]Brian WrightCopyright 2009	0
"This video is missing one of the funniest SNL sketches of the episode, ""Monex"" the fact that NBC Universal has deleted content from this episode should be CLEARLY marked so you know what you're getting. Additionally, it should not be priced as high if they're removing content. What's up with NBC preventing people from seeing this sketch? Did they get sued by Monex?"	0
This is all about the message. The madman, The lighthouse keeper. I know it all sounds strange and all that, but listen to the words. It may just give you hope!	1
I bought this book for a friend going through a divorce, luckily I read it first. In a section about a father not being involved with his children they accuse the mother of not making him feel welcome, in a section about court they advise women not to wear short shirts or make-up and it only gets worse. This book was written to convince women to stay married so they don't loss their children.	0
I tried it out and fell asleep on it. No noticeable leakage overnight. It seems to me like a good buy.	1
I guess maybe it said they have the right to change the cover, but the one we received was completely different! Looked like an old Harlequin romance novel.... also the book had people reviewing it along with the text and my daughter didnt like that format.	0
"I recently bought this book for my wife and had a terrible time finding it (and it was very expensive). She has loved John Masefield for who knows how long (since she was a child) and has shared favorite poems with me from this book. I have also read some of them and they are wonderful poetry and imaginitive enough for all aged readers and some powerful and beautiful enough to bring tears to myself. Highly recommended for anyone who loves the sea. I was lucky enough to find a nice hardcover with paintings that capture some of the sensations of the sea. Poems like ""Sea Fever"" are classics that frequently printed elsewhere (and quoted in a Star Trek movie :)), and it should be reprinted and made available in the United States where publishers seem unable to identify what American readers are intelligent enough to comprehend. Get this from the library if you do not feel like the investment."	1
The Kindle Edition of 1984 is incredibly sloppy. There are some blatant typos I'm surprised weren't noticed by editors, but the real slap in the face is when there are page numbers (from the print edition) in the middle of sentences that someone didn't bother removing when they copy/pasted the book from whatever was on file.	0
The charger works great and has a nice design. The cord could be a little longer, so you could use the phone more easily while it's connected to the charger.	1
I think Michael Bay may have phoned this one in. There are so many things wrong with this movie I don't know where to begin.	0
Saw the 6-hour version at the SF Film Festival special screening about eight years or so ago. Was not bored for a minute. Why are we being offered the truncated version? Only 2 stars for this version which is very disappointing after having waited so long for a Region 1 release. Really a shame.	0
The book, although hard to get excited about in the begining, offers insight into confrontations that you experience any given day during your life. It's thorough and offers helpful ideas.	1
Although many people prefer Morning Glory, this is my favourite Oasis album. I love the heavy, and to me very interesting production. The layered guitars, sound effects, keyboards and percussion create a marvellously powerful 'wall of sound'. I like all the songs on this record but the highlights for me are Do You Know What I Mean?, Magic Pie, Stand By Me, Don't Go Away and the magestic All Around the World. The songs on this album may seem very long and can be quite boring at first. But this is an album that should be listened to. It's fantastic to hear it all and focus on all the parts. It's an album that should be got and should be really listened to.	1
This is a great, fast-paced movie. I was initially skeptical of watching the same 20 minutes depicted three different ways, but this movie won me over from the beginning. Run Lola Run has style and energy, and I really did have a blast watching it.The music, the photography, the editing--everything contributes toward a very fast film experience. After watching it I felt like I needed to do everything as quickly as possible. Loads of fun.One of the great things about it is that it stands up very well to repeat viewing--watching it the second time was just as rewarding, possibly even more so, as the first. The interconnection of all the events in the film is much more clear the second time around (though not being as clear the first time doesn't hurt the film in the least).Highly recommended.	1
I saw the video for Galang on BPM and was laughing out loud. This skinny little Sri Lankan girl was spitting out london ghetto rap while dancing crazily in front of a cartoon backdrop. But the next few days, something about the beat stayed in my head. I had to hear it again. I did, and I taped it, and the more I listened to it the more I realized I wanted to hear more. I found it at a store and bought it. On the bus ride home I didn't much care for it, but like the Galang video, it stayed in my head. Everytime I listened to it I liked it a little bit more. It's like watching Pulp Fiction, each time you see it, something appears to you that you missed before that makes the whole thing make more and more sense. By now, it is one of my favourite CD's and I don't even listen to this genre (if it even fits into any genre) regularly. It isn't for everyone, but if you have a good subwoofer and an open mind for something unique...give it a shot.	1
"I am a sixth and I'm reading a book about five teenagers who died in the Holocaust. the first diary is about a teenager named David Rubinowicz and his diary is called ""The end of the world will soon be here"".Yitzak Rubasheuski is the second diary of the book and his diary is called ""Long live the youth!"" Moshe Flinker is the third of this book and his diary is called ""My name is Harry"". Eva Heyan's is the fourth diary and her diary is called ""I want to live!""Ann frank is the last diary of the book and her diary is called ""I must uphold my Ideals"". The reason I didn't wright anything about what happened is because I don't want to spoil the story for you. I liked this book because of the detials. The only bad part is that all the teenagers died."	1
We purchased six of these heaters in February 2006, and by November 2006 only one was still working. One was DOA, two died within one week of arrival, and the other two died over the next seven months. We live in Southern California so these heaters were rarely used so its not like they wore out. Repeated calls to DeLonghi customer service went unanswered, and the local service company they refer to in their service manual is no longer in business. We are very disappointed with the heaters and DeLonghi and would not buy one from them again.	0
For anyone who has ever wondered how the five human senses works, this is the tape to purchase! This film of the flagship series NOVA introduces a wealth of knowledge on seeing, hearing, feeling, taste, and smell. Anyone who has seen anything educational program from the NOVA series, now on PBS across the nation, knows the quality of their documentaries. This tape is no exception. This film is highly recommended to anyone who is interested in exploring these five basic functions of the body, taken for granted everyday. A real winner, this video will not disappoint!	1
"this book represents a time in the past of our country in which we should be ashamed. not only was this a time of ""witchcraft"" and witchunts, but the society was willing to ostracize a human being for adultery. as if it weren't punishment enough for hester to have to wear the ""a"" on her chest, everyone stared at her peculiarly and did not accept her into normal society. i think this is overly harsh, yet this whole book reflects the time in which it took place very well. i would recommend it."	1
Living outside of San Antonio and having friends involved in this project, I remember these kids being here and having prayed for them. I was not expecting to ever see the inside of the stories unfold. My heart is changed forever. Watching the anguish and the joy of these families who are trusting that these Americans are going to heal their children is overwhelming. The beautiful hospitality of the people who opened their homes to these families was deeply inspiring. Their faith in Christ is shown in this remarkable way that leads these Buddhist families to trust in Jesus Christ and to trust and thank Him. I cannot recommend this to you enough. Please watch it. Be challenged from your complacency and moved to heal the broken hearted. Be warned. If you are a parent, this will make you want to go to your children and embrace them.This dvd was graciously provided by Thomas Nelson Publishers for review.	1
I have had excellent experience with Pampers since our now two year old (26 pounds) was a preemie (3 pounds 15 ounces). The Baby Dry are just another example of the excellent quality diaper Pampers provides no matter what the size of your child. Our daughter does have a slender shape (little hips and butt) and these diapers have held in everything until she started moving around more (which is when we switched to Cruisers). We have also only experience two diaper rashes (very minimal) while using Pampers. I have tried Huggies and Seventh Generation and Kirkland, but Pampers has consistently worked the best for our daughter over the last two years.	1
Fabulous movie, can watch it over and over. Received quickly and as described. Love it love it love it	1
I notice that 9 of the reviews are posted by the same person, A Customer. It looks like the author is trying to get a better rating by making up reviews. The book is trash don't buy it.	0
At half the price of the original Apple adapter, this is a good value. That said, I do miss the lcd ring around the plug of the Apple adapter, the one that glows green or orange depending on if the laptop is fully charged or is currently charging. It's useful to discern at a glance if I can take my laptop and go without wondering if it's fully charged. Also, the glowing ring would indicate that it IS charging -- sometimes the other end of the electrical plug will come loose, and I wouldn't be aware that the computer isn't charging if it wasn't for the light. However, being on a limited budget, the lcd ring is a sacrifice I'd make to save nearly $40.	1
Yes cooking is my think. I but this book to see what type of recipes it had come to find out there are so much to choose from. So far I have not do all that is in this book but I like what I have cook so far.	1
The video version I ordered was not what I thought I was going to receive. I bought one to view and one to give as a gift. It was very dark with distorted characters and a great disappointment. It was hard to see at times and very unacceptable. In conscience I couldn't keep the one for me nor could I give the other as gift. That is why I returned both copies for a refund. Why do you not create a more modern colored version of Ahmal and the Night Visitors for a DVD?Thank you for reading my thoughts on this subject.	0
"I usually like the books better than the movie. It is an interesting book although it touches on everything and seems to repeat itself time after time. The movie focused more on the actual ""mothman"" and I felt the book just mentioned it among many other things. This book should have been named ""Mothman, Men In Black, UFOS, and the Kitchen Sink."" I was glad to be done with this book. Don't waste your money on this book, check it out from the library."	0
This product does work. I found it as a treatment for tinea or for any yeasty skin problems. The bar form is very good for travelling when liquids could leak. It has a mild scent and cleaned well.	1

"2 big complaints:1. great start with the archive video of the moon race, including references to NASA, Sputnik, and the Soviet moon probes. No story to follow.2. Dumb girl, ""eek!"" Really beautiful, but never physically confronts these huge machines. Hey, the guys are just as unmatched as she. She is shown at the start at resourceful & smart. Give her something! Her only power was in gossiping to the bad bots to play mind games.One small complaint:The little boy in me would love to see the transformers build into some mega bot, like Power Rangers do, or to use some junk around them to add to their arsenal."	0
the movie was pretty bad, but i would think that honors kids would be original enough to write their own reviews. alice's was good, those were her words, but kayla, jana...we were all there when noteboom said what you wrote and you're taking credit for it? please!	0

This collection of sentences and catch phrases is VERY weak on technical details and VERY heavy on the diatribe. In several instances, it is down right incorrect when referencing history. This book may fit the needs of a poli. sci. type, but it is less than a dust collector when it comes to those working in the fields of IT/IW/IA. As a 2 decade professional in the field, take my recommendation and avoid this book if you are looking for anything beyond recycled political phrases related to IW.	0
Wow, how would you like to own a DVD of 4 Simpsons Xmas episodes? Even though half of said episodes are utterly NON-Xmas. Even the title of this DVD is wrong as the first was called Christmas with the Simpsons.Included on this DVD is Homer vs. Dignity, Skinner's Sense of Snow, Dude Where's My Ranch? and 'Tis the 15th Season. None of these are from the old seasons, so they are all new to DVD. But their not from the best years either. They're the cynical, classless episodes from recent seasons.Yes, they are funny. But the laughs are incredibly cheap and their targets too easy to hit. For the price, it's hard to argue NOT getting for a single watch on Xmas eve (despite the fact only 2 episodes are about Xmas), but for misers I'd wait for the full complete box sets of these later seasons. Crap as they may be.The DVD presents all shows in 1.33:1 fullscreen, as drawn with Dolby 2.0 surround. One brief extra, an animatic, is included.	0
We haven't read the book, but the movie was horrible. It was completely ridiculous and unbelievable. It's one of the worst movies we've ever seen.	0
"This book is really full of common sense, but if you are new to web businesses, it may be of help but not worth the price tag.Mr. Rudl's website has several ""ANNOYING"" pop-ups that made me want to leave immediately.There are a lot of common sense themes in the book that can be found on any web-based business site, and a lot of the information is out-dated in my opinion.There is one good thing about the book though, and that's that it puts a lot of information together that would take a while to get on your own.In my opinion, Mr. Rudl is a good salesperson with good marketing skills. He makes his money by hawking his wares on his site, and it looks like he makes money by being an associate for other websites with ""featured"" products on his website.I don't recommend this ""book""."	0
"My Daughter pulled apart the ""tree trunk"" that came with this set and the tiny magnets inside fell out along with very small plastic parts. She is almost four but still put the ""candy"" in her mouth. We ended up spending half the day getting her checked out and now must watch her and her brother to make sure they did not swallow a magnet (one magnet is missing). she is not generally rough on her toys and this came apart way too easily. So if you have children under @ 6, beware. Only let them have this if you are right there with them at all times. If I hadn't been right there my child could have died."	0
Am trying to make due with it since I purchased. It's overpriced by $7 compared with the Spartan Sports Talking Pedometer (almost the same product except different colors for plastic). The stride mechanism also sticks occasionally and I have to shake the device to get it to work.I agree with previous comments - there are some problems. It's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns on the very annoying music, and it's too easy to accidentally press the button on top that turns the alarm on, and it's too easy to accidentally press the big button on the front that will speak the number of steps and distance you've walked.	0
Somehow I've never managed to read this book, even in school. I'd seen it for years in the library, but was always turned off by the title/cover. To be honest, I didn't even know what it was about. However, the minute I started reading it, I couldn't put it down! With interesting themes and characters, this is definitely a must-read classic!	1
This is the most thorough and informative book on divorce issues that I have read. As a divorce attorney, I am always curious to know what other attorneys are thinking. Ms. Smith's perspective and commentary mirror much of my own experiences and conclusions. The book is easy to read and filled with relevant, realistic examples and practical advice. I highly recommend this book to both nonlawyers, who have a reason to learn about this subject and to lawyers so they can refine and expand their knowedge of the divorce process.	1
We always have lots of grandchildren around and they are getting older so this bed comes in handy. Because it is raised up it is easier for me to put sheets on. So glad I tried it.	1
"I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"	1
This is the exact product we were looking for. It's compact, self filling, and pretty comfortable. It's perfect for traveling or when company spends the night. It provides the extra sleeping accommodations we needed. The 120v pump fills the bed quickly. The battery pump or foot pump wouldn't have worked well for us.	1

I was forced to watch this film with my girlfirend. I admit to being a film snob, and ask alot of the film i watch. But when it comes to mindless Buckhiemer stuff i really dont mind them. Then i saw this. Badly acted, scripted and directed. This film represents the kind of mindless stagnation that hollywood seems intent on sticking with. Films like this are a disease on what sould be and is ( sometimes) one of the most creative and efective media forms of the modern day. Please for your own sanity dont bother.	0
Props:- The diaper actually does a good job on dry out.Cons:- It is too thin to hold watery poop- It does not have a wetness indicator.Definitely not a good choice for new parents. I will probably buy it when the baby older than 6 months because it's cheaper than others.	0
I didn't really care for this book. Fahrenheit 451 is not far-fetched though. I think some of the material mentioned in this book really could happen in the future if we let it. This is a fairly good book overall, but I'm rating it a 2 out of 5 stars because I was just confused. I am a freshmen in high school and my whole Literature Pre-AP class had to read Fahrenheit 451 for an assignment. Now I know what you're probably thinking, well of course it's going to be confusing for a freshmen. But, I beg to differ. This book is written good I suppose, but the story jumps around too much and certain parts come up and it is just plain confusing (i.e. Dentham's Dentifrice). Well that is about all I have to say about this novel. I'm sure if I read it over again I would enjoy it more. But I don't think this book would be much more than 2 or 3 stars.	0
I recently took this on my last camping trip. Realizing that the light would be more useful than the fan. Where I was camping the nights were cold and the fan was not necessary. What was useful was the light that gave me a bright led that helped keep my tent lit when getting ready for bed. When I did try out the fan I was impressed by the air that came thru. Although my experience is more with the light I would say this is a necessary purchase for anyone taking a camping trip.	1
I ordered this mug warmer with a little skepticism, as I had ordered a similar product in the past only to be very disappointed with the results. The Mr. Coffee mug warmer, however, lives up to its claim and keeps my coffee nice and hot to the last drop. It's funny how something so mundane and inexpensive can bring such joy, but this one really delivers. If you hate luke warm coffee, this is your best bet!	1

"I would not recommend this product. When I plugged it in, it would not stop chirping. The directions said it might chirp ""a few times"" while powering up, but the thing chirped all day. Also, the 9 volt battery that came with the product did not fit into the battery compartment. The company that I bought it from told me to just throw it away, although I did receive a full refund."	0
"Okay...you have Tony- a twenty-something dude w/ dead end job, loser roommate, and no girlfriend. We never learn exactly WHY he decides to do community service work, but...he is on a Hotline team. The hotline is peopled by hot teen age girls in skimpy attire and a couple of oddball older guys like Tony.None of the characters or the plot twists are believable at all and of course it ends with Tony still lusting after the seventeen year old and waiting for her to ""be of age"". Hopefully she too will get murdered before she has to sleep with this loser in a sequel."	0
I didn't get to play with this much as it was a gift for my nephew, but from what I saw it was a well made toy. The magnet worked well and even the older kids wanted to play with it.	1
I'm very happy with this product, for me right now, they are perfect. The 4 rating is twofold however, one I can see how many people might not even be able to get a wrist in. I have small hands and had to struggle (but I like the snug fit), others probably couldn't even squeeze in. And also the material feels great, but looks a little dicey. The seams are already straining quite a bit with the struggling, I could easily see a rip in a few months of regular use. At 10 bucks though, I wouldn't mind an investment 3 times a year if need be. Anyway, great product, could be a tad bigger with sturdier material around the sides. But for right now, these are exactly what I was looking for to add to my cardio workouts.	1
purchased for two reasons: first, for a video presentation (connect to computer and speakers); second, for playing music at home and on the go. it works fine and is a great value for the money. buyer's remorses - would like a similar sized and quality product that has a remote control and bass/treble features	1
This is a warning to other Pratchett-lovers out there looking for audiobooks. This is an abridgment of the original book, and a bad one. A lot of the best word jokes and philosophical humor is missing, many scenes are in pieces, and the whole thing simply does not convey the sense of fun and insight of the original novel. As well, in my opinion, Tony Robinson is a horribly bad voice actor, but that may simply be a personal preference. [...]	0
Keep your hands of this movie, it definitley aint worth watching.The story is thinner than a crack ho on her last day on earth, unvoluntarily ridiculous and so placatively wanna-be-patriotic that homeland security shines outta your butt when ya bother watching this crappy movie.One of the worst movies i ve seen in years.	0
Dear Sirs,I purchased one of the Mr. Coffee CG12 coffeemakers in November of 2005. I have never seen a more poorly designed coffeemaker. What a piece of refuse! Because of its faulty design, it got coffee all over the countertop whenever it was brewing. I tried two of them and they both did the same thing. The whole design was slapdash. It should be taken off the market.After putting up with it for two months, I threw it in the trash and bought a Black and Decker. It was like going from a VW to a Rolls. Never again.	0
Clay said he's not an artist and he's absolutely correct. This CD is so unbelievably over hyped for a worthless collection of mediocre pop tunes sung by a mediocre singer who could not put emotion into a song if his life depended on it.Total manufactured crap.	0
I was excited to find a Christian-based sitcom to enjoy with my children. We watched them. They definitely were Christian based, but they were annoying. These are definitely not role models for my girls. I would not want my girls acting like them. The one is so loud and flighty. They both seem really into themselves and very superficial. I would love for more Christian sitcoms to become available, but this one did not make the cut for me. I'm disappointed. I had such high hopes.	0
"""Seduce Me"" is primarily a book about sexuality between couples. Many couples recall when they were first dating and it seemed that they were constantly touching each other. At time wears on that touching becomes less and less and sexual activity also declines. Author Darcy Cole discusses physiological and psychological factors in this change and how to get back the sexual fire. She notes that it takes very little to get men in the mood for sexual relations but men don't generally understand what is required to get a woman in the mood. This book details the various factors involved and how they work together to get a woman interested in sex. ""Seduce Me"" is very detailed in its descriptions and provides a wealth of information for those who want to understand the process of female seduction. While many parents would have a big problem with this book being included in a high school library, it is a very appropriate book for those wanting to increase their partner's sexual desire."	1
Clay Aiken's voice shines on this CD!!!! I bought this and well, I have bought one for my mom for her birthday. She has not been able to put it down!! She has listened to it over and over. Thank you Clay for a wonderful album and I can't wait till the next one!	1
If you want to spend $53 for one tiny trash can then this is the deal for you. This product should have been sold as a 6 pack but unfortunately someone messed up when they entered this product for sale. Both Amazon and Geroy's deny responsibility for the error and to date nothing has been changed. It was REALLY disappointing to get this in the mail & then have to turn around and return it. ALSO, you can't return this product without talking with someone at the amazon call center. This purchase was a huge WASTE OF TIME and I'm disappointed that it's still available.	0
"Let me add a piece of advice to the ideas proposed in this book. When you hear the words, ""Would you like to know more?"" just say ""No thank you, and close the door. Closing the door is VERY important. When I lived in Salt Lake City, I had to learn to do that, because some people wouldn't take no for an answer. One furious Relief Society lady was so upset with my attitude of unbelief that she pointed to my dog and said, ""I suppose you think that dog is just as good as you are!"" I replied, ""Probably better."" and THEN I shut the door and watched through the window as her embarrased husband tried to lead her down the porch stairs. She must have spread the word in the neighborhood, because I wasn't bothered after that. Though this book poses some good questions, my advice is to not even get started or you are in for an evening of flip charts!"	0
My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up.	1
For a cheap bow case, it really lives up to its name. I've traveled a few times to test it out and no problems what so ever! You get what u paid for.I have a mission craze bow and it fits well. There's room for everything i need to put in it!Cons and Problems-A little flimsy and doesn't seem too sturdy. And you have to put in the arrow holders when they should be able to put that together at the factory.Pros-Easy to take, compact, lightweight, holds arrows, holds everything you need, big enough, not too small, good foam padding.OVERALL it's a really nice case especially for the money. i would buy this case 1,000,000 times again. everything is great. the only not so good thing is the construction. it's nice. don't get me wrong. but it's a little flimsy.	1
It'a amazing to see how far our medical knowledge has come since the early 19th Century. I admire this woman tremendously - the courage it must have taken to face cholera with little more than egg whites and vinegar - but then, they didn't have a choice. I haven't finished it yet, but it's wonderful to have a primary source like this - should have made that election cake!	1
I have tried rabbit toys in the past and they have all been great, so I was very excited to try this product. I got it in the mail, put batteries in it, and... it wouldn't turn on. I wish I had read the reviews on this more carefully before buying this, as I see now that a lot of other people have had this issue. I really hope I can return it. Don't waste your money- if you want a rabbit, you might as well buy a real good quality one so you don't waste your money like I did.	0
"I love Adam Sandler. Well, I used to love him, before he made Eight Crazy Nights. Not only was this cartoon not funny, it was downright trash. I would not recommend this ""feature"" to anyone. ""Eight Crazy Nights"" was short on story, long on time, and wearing on patience. I kept watching in hopes that this cartoon would redeem itself; I needed some justification for wasting the 2 hours of my life that I will never get back. Needless to say, I stuck it out until the credits, and now I have to live with the facts that I: 1.) watched the movie; and 2.) I'll never get that time back. So now I sit here, typing away a review I doubt anyone will read, wasting more of my precious life on that ridiculous movie! HUMBUG! Watch ""Ishtar,"" you'll get more out of it. Oh, and I only awarded one star because Amazon insists you give everything at least one star. I did this under protest."	0
This was not a very good movie. I had to sheepishly explain to my wife why we had just wasted two hours of our valuable time. I had read some reviews that indicated that this movie was actually worth watching.Nothing could be farther from the truth! This movie was dry and boring the entire way through. And the suprise twist? An alien encounter would have made more sense.And the ending... If a story has to finish with a paragraph explaining or expounding the ending, then there is definitely something wrong. Unless a story is a true story or added for humor, beware of movies that end with a paragraph on the screen. It means that even the writer didn't like the screenplay.The only redeeming factor in this movie is that you get to see Elizabeth Hurley's chest, albeit from the side only.Anybody want to buy a slightly used copy?	0
I've bought this book, underlined every hint of symbolism, found all evidence of romanticism, followed every quote involving thematic oppositions, and noted every example of Pearl's rebellious nature and social alienation, but I cannot find one positive aspect of this novel that makes any of my hard work feel rewarding. The only way this novel could give me a warm feeling is if I place it in a furnace.	0

Civil War veteran John Carter is carried away to Mars. There, he impresses the giant green Tharks with his hand-to-hand combat skills, falls in love with Princess Dejah Thoris, and has many adventures. Very fun escapist yarn. Totally implausible, but never really asks you to take it seriously. Pure wish-fulfillment heroic fantasy. Burroughs' prose is a bit archaic and stilted, and some plot twists were too extraordinary to be satisfying. Overall, however, Princess is very entertaining pulp fiction.	1

This game is more based on the book then any other lotr game. But the battles are terribly slow, some items don't work, things that the game promised are taken out, the graphics are awful, and there are some terrible glitches in the game, especially the Moria Glitch which made me go out buy another one (I thought the first one was a defect) and go through the same glitch again. Even if you are a huge lotr fan you should probably stay away from this game.	0
This collection of tunes is an experiment with rock. I'm loving Bj√∂rk's vocals, all though over-produced to an inch of her life. This LP is too eclectic to be eclectic. Post seems an effort to please mainstream goons. The LP feels forced.	0
I read this book for my 11th grade Lit class and I must admit the book was quite a shock. Many of the books I have read have been nothing more than an attempt at delving into the inner parts of the human soul. This book does much more than that. It depicts the struggle of a man with himself and an outside enemy. He commits one of the most unspeakable acts of the time and punishes himself constantly. He lacks the courage to confess his crime and goes through a period of mental and physical torture. He also faces the wrath a cruel and vicious enemy who lives for nothing more than to torture his victim. All in all I believe it was an excellent book and I would reccomend it to anyone.	1
Definition of a bad book: a book that doesn't make you want to get to the next chapter. I kept trying to see if this would eventually grab me, but after maybe 10 chapters or so of plodding prose, I gave up. Thank goodness it was a library book.	0
This printer has been a nightmare. First I can not usemy Visioneer scanner. They say it is not compatable.I removed a jammed paper, and since then anything I print,such as invoices, checks and such, come out with blotchedprinting and paper tears. I get NO help from technicalsupport(They're learning). No 800 number, which means youhave to call CA on your buck.I used to swear by HP. Now I am convinced that theirproducts are close to junk. My opinion is STAY AWAY!	0
"I'm not happy with this book at all. I'm not a scientist outside of the field of information technology and I want something to explain Einstein's theories that I could read. I read such a book when I was young. It's out of print, but you can purchase it on Amazon used. It's entitled ""Relativity: The Special and the General Theory--A Clear Explanation that Anyone Can Understand"" by Albert Einstein.That did it for me, this book put me to sleep."	0
"An extremely accurate view of the thoughts and feelings of people into the light s/m scene. Although the setting and plot are (most likely) fictional, Rice has done something here I've never seen before - realistically portray the eroticism and appeal of this sexual lifestyle. Much better than her over-the-top Beauty series.One flaw, though, was her tendency to hang people by their hands for long periods - definitely dangerous and never done by responsible ""players"". Don't try this one at home!"	1
This is 2nd one I had in 3 years, same model same problem started to show right after one year. Zojirushi customer service found all kind the excuses not willing to take care of it, they wanted me call service center, which they charging service fee $138- up-front(about the same price for buy a new one)....I will never buy Zojirushi again.	0
the discs all worked well and the case was in good shape. the retailer was very helpful in shipping it to me.	1
this cd got more credit then it should of........in other words this cd sux...when i watched american idol he was the worst person on the show....i was so glad he didn't win he has no talent.....but when he started making an album then i was even more disapointed because he didn't even win and he has more fame than Rubin who i think was lots better....so if u read this don't buy it.....its not worth your 13.99.	0
This book will tell you that six sigma is an excellent quality improvement program, (You probably heard this already) yet authors won't equip reader with the tools that six sigma offers. I read this book twice with a strong desire to understand the principles of the six sigma, but after reading it cover to cover twice I got nowhere.I like to read, and through the years I read a lot of books, but consider this to be the worst business book I read so far! Jack Welch, in his book Winning (which I strongly recommend) dedicates one short chapter to Six sigma, and it covers everything you will learn from this book. This book offers no substance what's so ever!!	0
While this book on nutritional biochemistry was adequate when it came out in 1999, much has changed in seven years. Without an update of the way daily allowances are now determined, new findings in the area of molecular biology, etc. the potential buyer may be rewarded by waiting for the next edition. It is interesting to note that most of the reviews came from the author.	0
This book was horrible.I had to read it but in my own opinion this book really had nothing to do with witches.They only mentioned a few things about withches.For example ,when the main character{Kit}jumped in the water to save the little girl's doll,they just mentioned she could get in trouble for swimming.Another example of this would be how Kit was put on trail.They just said she was but it would have made the story a lot more interesting by adding the twist that she was found guilty. The story was actually about how dating worked back in colonial times.The author mentioned that in order to go out with someone that the male had to ask the father's permission in order to call on the female.An example of this would be when an admirer of Kit{William Ashby} asked Kit's uncle if he could call her out.He did this by sucking up to him then asking him his permission.In conclusion, my once again is that this book has nothing to do with witches or witch craft.	0
A disappointing movie: clich√©-ridden directing, cardboard scenery, and acting that I feel is now dated, despite the presence of the great Ian Richardson and a young Martin Shaw. The low point IMO is Ian Cuthbertson, all too often featured in those days, for whom acting solely means raging and shouting with rrrolling eyes and a rrrolling 'r'.	0
This book was not about neccesarily; the future. But it was about the society we live in today, and how actually close we really are to this horrific view of the future: where firemen are sent to burn books. The things Guy Montag went through, were just horrible, and the war was out of control. The hobos; or outcasts from society; were a great addition. The reason for their outcast, one might wonder: books. Montag realized this when that woman killed herself. I treasure books, and the thought of this ever happening blows my mind. Try this book!	1
This game is awesome! If you are looking for a really nice and very addicting playstation 2 game that will never make you bored! I would highly recommend this game! The 3d action, and great quality makes this game outstanding, and for Amazon's very low price, this is a must have!	1
"SYSTEM OF A DOWN's TOXICITY is the greatest hard rock album of 2001 and System Of A Down is one of the best bands out of the so called ""NU-METAL"" scene. This is a great album because it is heavy and fast and has meaning. System Of A Down is a Excellent band. My favorite songs on this album are:NeedlesDeer DanceChop SueyBounceForestToxicityPsychoAerials"	1
I was very happy with this DVD set (and in fact just ordered the breastfeeding DVD from the same instructor). I watched it in lieu of attending childbirth classes and do not regret that decision. I had read several books about labor and delivery, etc., and can't say that the video really contained a lot of new information but it brought the information together nicely and made me feel more prepared overall. I also appreciated the fact that the instructor did not spend a lot of time on breathing techniques and did not overly emphasize natural childbirth. Instead, she discussed the desirability of postponing medications until the labor is well underway because of the cascade effect of interventions (which seems sensible to me). But she certainly didn't try to push going natural all the way. As for the humor, it's not anywhere near as bad as some other reviews have made it out to be.	1
Get the German Version with the English Subtitles. Yes, the techo music gets annoying but it's a really good movie. You'll see lots of recurring themes of this in the near future. How everything you do, regardless of how small, has some impact on the rest of the world. There's a show on the Discovery channel called Connections with James Burke that details how everything is related to everything else. Yet it all appears to be a big mess of chaos. It's beautiful in it's insanity.	1
I bought two stations and two sensors for the outside of our house. I can now hear when anyone comes to the house in both my bedroom and other end of the house. The sensors work great and do not give any false alarms when set up properly. Set up of the units is very simple. Being able to add up to six sensors per station works excellent and being able to have each sensor send signals to both base units is great. The range of the wireless is very good also. I highly recommend the voice alert for anyone trying to protect there outside perimeter.	1
"1984 is one of the best novels ever written in English. The dismal world of the ""future"" presented here is beyond belief but also seems within reach. Although it may seem to be a warning against communism (some of the elements are found in A Darkness at Noon - a true critique of the pogroms of Stalin), it is in fact a warning against excess that can occur in any government system.The foreward by T. Pynchon provides some insights, especially about the last chapter on newspeak, but be warned that it does provide spoilers."	1
I would like to thank the seller for the great quality and the fast shipping :) i really liked your service	1
I enjoy history and this historical fiction was terrific. Having grown up in the NYC area, I found the historical aspects very informative. The plot was complex but engaging. After reading this book by Maan Myeyers, I went on to read the entire series. A very good read and I recommend it.	1
Much faster than my old 2100.Hard to beat for the price.Plugged in USB cable and printing in 3 minutes.	1
"Vastly illustrated and very informative. Although the majority of this book is pictures (very nice ones at that), there are some very interesting facts and historical information about the victorian card craze. Because there are in excess of 100,000 different cards in existance, don't expect to find every card in here or the current market price. It is just a matter of time before a more extensive guide is published, (I would still recommend because of the great illustrations!) The only problem I have with this book is the layout which can be annoying if you are trying to find info on one of your cards. You have to search through several sections of the book. (e.g. Jackson's chewing tobbaco card in the ""Exploration and Travel"" chapter instead of the ""Tobbaco"" chapter). More expensive cards are usually only discussed in the chapter rather than illustrated, which I find kind of strange(Maybe he didn't own any of those to get the photo?)."	1
I've seen printed versions of this book and I've been thinking about getting it for a while. Never in my wildest dreams did I think the kindle version would be in black and white. When discussong color and showing diagrams showing the actual colors really helps. I am soo soo disappointed with this purchase. The books content itself is amazing but I'm going to rethink ordering ebooks from amazon in the future.	0
While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat.	0
I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections.	0
What happens with Billy? It is the age what it has affected? Why it wants to be the cartoon of Sinatra?Honestly I continue waiting the return of great pop rock or good new wave rock of Glass Houses! But Billy sadly very sadly your music is made for old man's lovers of Sinatra. Argggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"This item is excellent for the first layer of protection for your video iPod. As the description says, this is not a sticker with adhesive on it, but a ""static cling polymer plastic"", which is very easy to put on and reposition.The front cover covers the click wheel and most of the face, leaving very little open to scratches. The back cover covers most of the flat section, but doesn't extend to the curved section. Mine is going inside of a Speck Products iPod Video ToughSkin, so no worries there.On a side note, beware of the ""More Buying Choices"" sellers who are offering the ""same"" product at $0.01. I purchased one of these first and got a similar, but much inferior product. It had the same dimensions as the Powersupport product, but it was a sticker and was very hard to apply. It was very prone to have air bubbles that I couldn't rub out. Do not buy the $0.01 product and expect to get the Powersupport XA-01 Crystal Film.Enjoy your well-protected iPod."	1
"I enjoyed berry's novel,The Amber Room, and thought this would be worth reading. It wasn't!! The plot was well done,but when it came to the revelation of the ""secret"", I moaned and wanted to toss the book across the room. What a letdown!! I literally laughed out loud and thought just another liberal minded person wrote this book. Very disappointing"	0
An earthquake opens a crack in the earth, the parents fall in, and it slams shut!?!?!? That's the best Auel could do? Has that EVER happened in history to ANYONE?I read that and threw the book in the trash. And it wasn't even my copy!	0
The Black Keys are one of the best bands around today. This album is great from start to finish. You will not be disappointed. I saw them in concert and they are just as great live as they are on CD. If you are interested in good old bluesy rock then this band is for you.	1
The measure of a man is more than three inches!!This is manufactured pop music. It has no soul. It was put together by a studio to be sold to the masses... It was purposely designed to be offensive to no one, therefore it was put in a box. Did Clay write these songs? They all follow the same pop music formula... Amateur songwriters at RCA must be stamping out hit songs by the thousands, all with cliched lyrics.. Now they can stamp out pop stars who have nothing to say and no reason to be famous.Tori Amos, Madonna, Christina.. They write their own music and have something to say. When they do a cover, they have enough taste to choose something powerful and relevant. They don't sing schmaltzy, sappy cookie-cutter pop songs. Buy records from people who have the balls, creativity, and imagination to make a work of art, and not just do what is accepted. Support the leaders, not the followers, and make a change.	0
"There is no argument that the soundtrack that this album is from is a well crafted and artistic film but unfortunately the songs have been so overproduced since the original 1976 much rawer concept album that it loses much of the ""edge"" and message.I hope it wasn't star ego that led to Madonna (playing Evita) singing ""Another Suitcase in Another Hall"". The switch in cast (it was originally sung by the mistress Evita was throwing out - who disappears from view in this album) completely loses the pathos and point of the song and does a great dis-service to the whole piece.Buy the 1976 concept album first with Paul Jones (possibly the most under-rated Peron) and Julie Covington (singing a really hard-nosed ladder-climbing Evita) to hear how this should sound on audio."	0
The Mr Coffee - 4 cup coffeemaker arrived as promised...packaged well. It is just right for one person and fits nicely on the kitchen counter. I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a couple of mugs of coffee...it brews quickly and stays hot.	1
"The newly updated film version of Shirley Jackson's ""The Haunting of Hill House"" is somewhat acceptable. If your looking for some good effects and a strong character lead, ""The Haunting"" is your cup of tea. For the rest of us who want something scary, ""The Haunting"" was definitely not it. For the first hour of the movie, it's creepy and fun as we explore the house along with the actors. But as the second half begins to roll, ""The Haunting"" loses steam. If your a person who enjoys the sights and sounds of a high budget film, buy ""The Haunting"". But for those who want class in their horror flicks, definitely leave this one out of the collection."	0
We all truly enjoyed this movie! The picture quality was beautiful and I know I will watch it again! Awesome!	1
turned into a totally different story. I liked the beginning, but closer to the ending i could not believe that was the same book. There were good ideas that were abandoned by the writer, and the characters acted stupid most of the time.I do not reccomend this book.	0
Started an order, which I never completed. Looked at my card and they had withheld the amount for the order, which I never completed! Called them, and they confirm that I haven't placed an order, but they are unable to credit my account in another 10 days! This was on a gift card!The customer service agent promised to take care of it first thing and he even stated that he was going to email me immediately the next morning. Two days later, after no email, I called and they have no idea of my issue, and we start over again with the talk about the 10 days. Noone seems to know why they've taken over $200 from the card.	0
Although though we're (presumably) members of the same political choir, the author treats economics much too simplistically.Calling this book a polemic on Keynesian economics would be accurate, calling it an economics treatise would be just plain wrong.Time would be better spent reading Bastiat.	0
I purchased this for my father who about 10 times a day puts his cup of coffee in the microwave to warm it up. I figured this would save him a lot of time if it worked. However, it just didn't keep the coffee hot enough. Nice idea though.And before anyone comments saying he didnt use it correctly, he did. He poured a fresh cup of hot coffee, used this coffee warmer like a coaster. Within about 30 minutes, he had to make another trip to the microwave.	0
The book changed my boundaries. I have become aware of my limitations and now I truly believe that these boundaries are not limitations but gifts in disguise. I realized the importance in one's short comings is the lesson that it presents for the seeker. Thank-you.	1
I thought the dvd was concert footage and it is still shots with music. I do love this album from Motorhead though.	0
I bought the silver version and this product is junk. It is cheaply constructed and broke the instant I attempted to place my palm TX in it. The cheap plastic slide piece that attaches the PDA to the case would break in a stiff breeze. The neoprene lining lifts off in humid weather or whenever it feels like it. The memory card slots are a joke and the shoddy belt clip is the punch line. Without a doubt, the worst online purchase I have ever made.	0
I found this to be one of the most engaging books I have read in a long time. I read it in three nights and was sad when it was over. The author appears to have done a LOT of research on this subject, amply illustrated by his extensive notes at the end of the book. It's great to read a book that is both well-researched and well-written. My only complaint, a small one, is that I wish he had spent more time discussing the racial dynamics of the crew. Unlike some authors, Philbrick definitely didn't ignore this topic. But when the African-American members of the boats die off and are eaten, one by one, I was totally incredulous. How could this have happened? I thought Philbrick could have spent more time discussing other historic shipwrecks where there were racial issues involved. Perhaps, however, there really wasn't enough data to go on. Anyway, as I said, I greatly enjoyed this book.	1
I have tried many diaper brands including many store brand diapers. However, I always end up going back to Pampers even though they cost more. Pampers are the softest and they seem to hold the most waste. They also seem to keep kids the dryest and the Baby Dry does not tend to fall apart. These diapers have good elasticity and can fit many body types. Additionally, they stay secured well and resecure well if they need to be refastened.My only complaint is the Pampers rewards program. The point system is very skimpy and it takes a very long time to accrue enough points to get a meaningful gift.	1
"I really enjoyed this book!I couldn't put it down after the first page which compares Marshall, ""An average North American Male"" ... ""plump and balding"", to his caged pet bird - ""Both had lived three fourths of their expected life span and had another fourth of life to go, if they were lucky"".This sets the tone for the novel which is a thought provoking story written with wit and intelligence.I should note, however, this is not and it is a book about the character Marshall Hollenzer. It is really a book about people - the choices they make and/or the fate bestowed upon them - and journeys - both physical and spiritual.This novel is thought provoking, entertaining, and enlightening.I recommend buying at least two copies - this is the type of book that you will want to share with people you know."	1
okay people dont get this book! There is missing pages in it when ever some one reads a paper or document! save your money and get different one!	0
I ordered it for a wart on my knee. Although I did see it begin to work by turning the wart black, this was a very thin layer. After the thin layer turned black and fell off I began the process again. Again, (2 weeks later) a thin layer turned black. I used this wart stick for almost 2 months before I grew sick of it's results and went to the doctor to have it frozen off.	0
"I found this book by luck; it was misplaced on a bookstore shelf. First, I liked the use of a person of color as the protagonist: someone who just happens not to be white. Second, I found the planet Melaquin, and its native inhabitants, uniquely intriguing. The only part I found difficult to buy is her ""deformity."" I, too, am a woman with a port-wine stain on my face, and I've never thought of it as a deformity. I've never tried to hide it. Perhaps hers (I can't recall) was over more of her face than mine. Nevertheless, I was sorry to get to the end of the book. It gave me the same kind of strong-woman-on-a-harrowing- adventure-pleasure as the movie ""Aliens 2"" did. I want more of same."	1
This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
"It just didn't hit the spot for me. I found the whole religious thing to be irrelevant. The exoctic mystical eastern religious fascination came across as being dated to me, a bit of a hippy/60s thing. And because of that, I was not really motivated to suspend my disbelief. It all seemed like magic rather than science, and therefore just a bit silly. If the story and the characters had resonated with me, maybe I would have liked all the battles and action at the end, but it all came across as a bit Bruce Willis-esque.I did like the line ""the fit hit the Shan"", though."	0
It may sound corny to some but the people described in this book represented the values of the majority in their time. It's only because of them and hundreds of thousands like them in the U.S and other countries, that Americans enjoy the riches and freedoms that we take for granted today. The book could have been large enough to fill up a good size library. However, Tom Brokaw did an excellent job of choosing a good cross-section of the country. I was impressed with his own insights to that time and got the feeling that his words were from the heart. As the son of a waist gunner on B-17's and POW who never spoke of the War until his last few years, I whole heartedly agree with the title of this book.	1
"A fan since the beginning I've seen every show there was..loved the final 2 hour wrap up of StarGate, even if you never watched a show, this would be fun for some who like Sci-Fi! I enjoyed several of the fun things Ben Browder slipped in while taking Command of the starship... and the fact that many of our past ""bad guys"" come back for one last peek.. Love owning this... nothing like a rainy day with some snacks and a great Stargate to watch!"	1
As others had said, this table is CHERRY. I bought it because I needed a larger table for my walnut chess board and the woods do not match at all -- though the table matches my cherry bookshelves perfectly (which is what I was hoping for from the other reviews). If you order from Amazon directly the packaging will be second to none and the table will arrive quickly.My only complaint was one little chip on the inside of one leg, but it's well hidden. This is a great product and you should buy without hesitation.	1
"I felt like cheering most of the time as I read this book. Ms. Venker writes so articulately regarding many of the thoughts I have had as a mother, but didn't know how to express. She is thoughtful in her comments and very honest. She doesn't portray motherhood as being totally blissful, but does express the importance of actually parenting your children once you decide to have them. She helps us to realize that, as we have more and more choices in our lives, there are always repercussions to our choices. We need to make sure that our children's needs are our first priority as we make our choices. We can ""have it all"", but maybe not all at the same time. Thank you, Suzanne, for saying what we all need to hear!"	1
these were advertised to fit the habra stone. they did not. i don't know if they changed the advertisement since then but it was aid to be a package with the habra stone so i got it. not even one piece fit. threw them away	0
Nappy... this book gets down to the nitty gritty. Venus and Kandi are so real. I could see myself in both characters. I think many black women are like Venus, independent, take charge, and wish or have tried (as I have) cutting their hair off. Kandi, on the other hand, is what we have to at least appear to be to black men so that we are considered attractive- long hair, sexy, somewhat dependent, emotionally needy, and not intimidating. If you want to read a book that is not only pleasurable to read, but infused with a realistic look at the lives of young black women then I think you will enjoy this one.	1

If you enjoy escaping into a world where you can be a witness to adventure, intrigue, romance, acceptance and a bit of magic then this outstanding novel is for you. You arfe able to withdraw from the real world and enter into Grimsley's and Beekman's world. You will be able to become one of the characters of the book, eat with them, ride with them, care about them. I couldn't put it down! Everything was tastefully done, I'd love to read a sequel.	1
This book is loaded with errors and typos; structures and chemical names don't correspond. A cyclohexane is called a benzene. It makes me doubt the author's credentials. If you are already confused with Chemistry, this book will only make it worse. DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Do not attempt to use it to prepare for your important graduate school admission exam either. You'll be better off without it.	0
"This is the second book I've read by Sylvia Browne. I enjoy her insights and the information about dreams, life after death, astral visits, etc. I am always interested in reading spirituality books, and I found this book of dreams very enlightening.I have recently read ""What Dreams May Come"" by Richard Matheson about life after death, and what I found interesting was that his book was written in the late 70's and a lot of Browne's facts/theories in her book match with what Matheson wrote about in his fictional love story. (The Hall of Wisdom, Working plateaus, etc).There were still a few times while reading ""Book of Dreams"" where I had to really shake my head and wonder, ""Wow, is she for real??"" But I kept reading and I think the ideas and theories do make some sense. Since her theories are hard to prove, our faith and beliefs are what spirituality is all about. I enjoy Browne and her books, and I rate this read a 4 out of 5 stars."	1
"Telemann: Sinfonia spirituosa; String Concertos is a recording under the direction Reinhard Geoebel leading the Musica Antiqua K√∂ln on this Deutsche Grammophon GmbH recording from 2002. It contains a well-written essay entitled ""Georg Phillip Tellemann: A Musician Abreast Of The Times"" written by Richard Goebel and translated into English by Richard Evidon. The performance by Musica Antiqua K√∂ln is nothing short of splendid and I thorougly enjoy this recording. Highly recommended. 5/5."	1
Batman begins is a great movie, there is no doubt about that as I'm sure you all know. That's just it though.. its the only thing great about this set. The postcard picture's are nice but whatever you know? And the comic is alright but it doesn't really have any of the character's you wanna see, it's just the bank job from The Dark Knight so it's no big deal. In the end I can only recommend this movie the the truly HARD CORE hard core fans of the new batman movie's. For me (a fan of batman but not a hard core fanatic) just the blu-ray it's self would have been a better buy.	1
It was the product my daughter needed for school. I find the book binding rather flimsy but it doesn't need to survive longer than her course and it wasn't expensive so I can't complain.	1
I bought this figuring I got a good deal on a CD player, turns out I just wasted my money. The headphones were horrible, they had a lot of static. And the player itself, well it had to be on a completely flat surface. In a car is not a good place to listen to it. It skips often, and it broke only after a month of purchase.	0
This is possibly my favorite post 2000 band. I mean it is the best metal gets. Its political, hard and down right cool. John Dolmayan one of the coolest drummers makes me proud to be a drummer. Some of the songs were just funny little songs and some of them were angry rock and some of them were just memorable. but i still wish there was osme way to put it all together	1
Just as described, perfect fit, shipped very quickly, and gret mats for my son's Ford Focus. He as very happy with this gift.	1
This did not work very well, at all. I ended up throwing it out after a very short period of time. I would go with the Health o meter!	0
"The one time I attempted to watch this concert was immediately after watching ""Miracle"" by the 12 Girls Band (both concerts were on the same DVD for some odd reason). I was able to sit through only a few pieces before having to eject the DVD. While ""Miracle"" showed the 12 Girls Band to be a class act exhibiting skillful musicianship, elegance and femininity, Bond came across like some goofy teenage girls lacking class, elegance and femininity. OK, so they are skillful musicians; not good enough."	0
"Harper Collins is about to join Penguin books in the Kindle boycott.I'm was set to put my enter Pratches library on Kindle but won't when I can buy a new mass market paper back at 20% less, right here on Amazon, from an ""alternate"" seller."	0
"I can't pick up my own guitar without trying to play some of the lines Duke puts together on these numbers! He really smokes on ""Easin' In"". Unlike what some others may say, I think his swing chops are awreet and that the major problem here is that Herb Ellis is a little stale and staccato, but that's only compared with the Herb of yesteryear. This album is a fine excursion into this genre of jazz/blues and will be appreciated by more than just a purist jazz or blues oriented audience. Buy it and enjoy!"	1
I purchased this for my daughter, expecting her 1st child. She loved it! Tons of information in a FUN way! Very enjoyable and informative.	1
I got the shoes really quickly. They were very well priced. They arrived pretty quickly in the mail, although I wish they had arrived slightly quicker.	1
As mentioned in other reviews the actual quality of the video's visuals is not so great but I didn't find that in any way a problem as the content was great. All the basic moves are covered and broken down in a helpful way and each includes several tips for why you may not be getting a specific move and what to try to correct it.I got the video for the trick instruction but also really enjoyed the work out section. Will definitely be trying some of the higher level videos next.	1
I received my new wires just in time for the weekend and the new family Toyota Tacoma got some new wires. It took quite a bit of work to remove the throttle body intake tube, in order to get to the front plug wires on the passenger side but it was worth it. The wires fit perfectly. I recommend you clean the throttle body while you have the intake tube off. Having the TB up high makes it easier to clean the butterfly with a sturdy toothbrush.	1
I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON	0
"Don't get me wrong.....I am 100% Clay fan....but....this CD was a disappointment. The songs are more teeny-bopper type of songs. ""David Cassidy"" re-visited. His choices of music on American Idol suited him much better. Hopefully his NEXT CD will bring him back to that format."	0
I never received this item. The seller sent this item to my shipping address at my billing address. 2 different addresses as we do not receive mail at our house.	0
"It took a while to get into this cd. Though I often admire Bill Laswell, sessions that he produces are often terribly uneven (except Sharrock's Ask the Ages where he basically lets the music do the talking). The title track starts with an ""ambient"" percussion section that makes you want to say ""laswell is a genius."" This is followed by an ""afro-pop"" song/rap that makes you want to say ""why does Laswell have to mess with everything."" The problem today is, everybody thinks you have to fill up a whole CD with music. Try programing this disc without the ""smooth jazz"" Midnight in berkely and the title track and I believe you will find this could have been Pharoah's best album and it still clocks in at about 50 minutes."	1
Tre Hardson (of the Pharcyde), is without a doubt one talented individual...this album is incredible and should be owned by everyone interested in hip-hop and quality music...The only artist I can compare him to is K-os from Vancouver, BC...flows, lyrics, some singing...this is dope...and I listen to artists like Killah Priest, Billy Woods, Mr. Lif and Reef the lost Cauze.

Nicely told story of how a modern-day detective using instinct and common sense unravels the defamation of England's King Richard III. Unfortunately the alternate suspect proposed for the murder of his nephews is probably not the guilty party; the most likely suspect, Henry Stafford, Duke of Buckingham, is only mentioned in passing. Also some evidence is now outdated. Still, a nicely told rebuke to the traditionalists and Shakepeare for perpetuating the defamation of a man who might have become one of England's greatest and most humane monarchs.	1
I loved this book in high school and now that I'm reading it ten years later the messages are even more relevant and insightful.	1
"I was in the seventh grade when I first read a ""Tree Grows In Brooklyn"". At the young age that I was, I still knew I had read a book that had changed my life or at least the way I looked at things. This is a book that will make you smile and say thats me! And by time your done with it you will find that a little bit of it is a part of you. Since I first read it I have tried to find as many books as a can that Betty Smith has written. I have suceeded in finding only two, ""Maggie Now"" and ""A Joy In the Mourning"". I have poured over these novels and dread the day that there will be know more left to find. Reading one her books has become to me like sitting down and being very content and confortable. I have had the previlge of reading many good books and understanding them. But there are none as good as reading The Tree for the first time."	1
Love that I discovered the option of purchasing diapers on Amazon!!!! They state that they are used but are perfectly fine. THANK YOU THANK YOU	1
I ordered this item on or around August 15th. It is September 13th and I have still not received this item. I emailed the shipper on numerous occasions about the item. The shipper even went as far as to lie and state that my shipping information was lost. I provided the shipper with my shipping information yet again and still did not receive the book not to mention the shipper stopped responding to my emails. Needless to say I had to file a claim with Amazon and I just went and bought the book from Borders....just buy books or whatever else this shipper is selling elsewhere...it may be more but at least you will get your item!	0
"this DeLonghi DFH550R heater is an extremely poor product and the customer service is non-existent,doesn't have a physical address or phone number and never gives their names...buyer beware...read their absolutely ridiculous return policy before buying...if you open any package they won't take it back...if you write a truthful negative feedback, they'll be after you like "" ticks on a hound "" !!!"	0
This book is not only about the theory of enterprise risk management, but also a summary of the author¬°s experience in practicing risk management for more than twenty years. And what is more, there are several case studies that are deeply analyzed in the book. It is because of this that I think it is an excellent work on enterprise risk management. In addition, it is interesting that the Balance of the Yin and Yang in the Chinese traditional philosophy is applied as Lesson 7 by the author. It is a must read for all business managers and students who want to pursue a career in risk management.	1
I love every song. Each song is so unique and versatile in melody that I play it several times a day. Can't seem to get enough of him. Also bought the Christmas cd. Best songs are from Clay and Kelly, all the rest are ok.	1
La primera entrega de esta saga, thumbs up, la entrega fue justo a tiempo y el producto en perfectas condiciones!	1
I needed to upgrade from 128 MB to 512 MB. The memory got to my home through UPS (plus a dog bone for my dog) within about 5 days. Installed easily once I figured out where HP had the memory on the motherboard (behind the drive chassis!). Everything is working like a champ. Excellent buy and compatibility for an upgrade.	1
My husband and I purchased this DVD after attempting to attend an in-person childbirthing class....they just weren't for us. We loved being able to watch this DVD at our leisure in the privacy of our own home. This was one of two DVD's that we purchased and this one was by far the best. Sheri's sense of humor was perfect for the subject matter in my opinion. It really put my mind at ease (a lot of the other courses really scared me) and I feel extremely prepared for labor and delivery. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who wants the benefit of being knowledgeable of labor and delivery, yet is hesitant to join an in-person class. I'll certainly keep this one and watch it for subsequent pregnancies.	1
I ordered this movie and another as region 2 not understandin what that meant. When I received the movie it would not work and I could not figure out why. I emailed Movie Mars they explained but since it ws my fault it was not worth returning. I think they should make a side caption for region two explaining it. If I would have known what it was I would not have ordered it. These were a Birthday gift. I had to reorder the right region so I had to wait and give the gift late. Plus I just threw away the othe movies!	0
I've been using this product for a few years now and cannot imagine ever being without it. I have terrible dark circles under my eyes and the difference after applying this product is remarkable. I HIGHLY recommend it.	1
Little publicity gained from club pro, other than the infamous club pro's students who do good. These pros (male and female now) are true backbone of the sport, feeding the sport. In this case, Claude Harmon Jr. reflects on his father, famous club pro and player who wore the coveted Green Jacket.One clearly learns of life lessons Butch carried to his life and students from his father. Salient to his father's remarkable and here documented career is association with Henry Ford and Ben Hogan.There are many gleanings to take from this for golf, for life. Worth read which is personal and honest and passionate, reflecting the author.	1
When Katherine Tyler, Kit, comes to stay with her Aunt Rachel's family in the Connecticut, she knows her new home will never be the same as her old home, Barbados. Kit doesn't seem to fit in in this strict Puritan colony. When her young sailor friend, Nat, is around, he's always teasing and that doesn't really help, either.Then Kit befriends Widow Hannah Tupper, a.k.a. (also known as), the Witch of Blackbird Pond. With Hannah Tupper, Kit can let go and speak her real feelings. She feels almost as happy as she did back in Barbados. And she cannot understand why everyone is so misunderstanding towards Hannah Tupper.So when Kit's new family warns her to stay away from Hannah Tupper, to avoid trouble from the rest of the town, Kit ignores them. Unfortunately, her friendship with the so-called witch is discovered. And Kit is also accused of witchcraft!	1
the item description says this is aluminum, but when i received the item, the box says 'solid steel'. very dissappointing! i live by the beach and steel doesn't last long. it was for my son's birthday, now i have to send it back and he won't have his main present!	0
I bought these to go with the Jawbone 2 because the ear piece they use will not stay in your ear and the loops that go over your ear just does not fit.These are great and they set in your ear nicely.	1
I love Clay Aiken, and yes, I could probably listen to him sing the phone book. BUT, this album is truly fantastic, IMO. My favorite song changes daily, even hourly, and I love every track on the CD!! I can't remember this happening since Carole King's Tapestry, umpteen years ago! I love romantic, sing-along-able songs and this CD is loaded with them. Not enough edge, some critics are grousing?? Hey, there's more nerve-grating edge than I can bear in today's music world; give me more, more, more of this kind of music, and I'll buy as much as I can possibly afford, for myself and for gift-giving!	1
This is the first system of a Down album I have heard and I must say it is one of my favorites. All the songs have words that actually go together thay say SOMETHING as opposed to bands like Blink 182 (everytime i look for you is a perfect example). Aside from the lyirs (which I say can be very depressing), the style of music is awesome and the voice of the lead singer is extremely unique. Can't wait for their next album, but if you're wondering what to add to your CD case next, Toxicity is a very safe bet.	1

There are 6 domains and 20 objective, in those 6 domains, of Exam, so count how many questions are per domain (6!!!). Some topics have only 3 questions, and on Exam you will get 3 or more questions from that objective.Before every domain there is list of articles (Training Kit + Books Online) to read for that domain, and every time they write how to start Books Online (klik Start menu, Programs, etc.) 3 - 4 line for somebody that goes on 70-229!!!.1/4 (to 1/3) of almost every page is unused (empty).If 2 or more answers are wrong for the same reason, they will repeat explanation, several lines, again and again.Some questions are for total begginers, and for some you need a lot of expirience.During my web exam expirience I noticed that questions are a little bit easier than the most on the Internet.So if you are total begginer and you have extra money, buy it, but for expirienced people I recomend something like www.certportal.com or other web sites.	0
This man's voice is even better than I remember it from the show. Some of the material is a little trite, but Clay's soaring voice and interpretation make it rise above the fray. Clay paints his lyrics for the listener - committing to every word. I really enjoyed the simplicity, albeit, Christian overtones of Measure of a Man, the confidence in Run to Me and for some reason, I can't get I Will Follow You out of my head. If this were the 80's or 90's, he'd easily have 3 or 4 solid singles from this album. Sadly, non-melodic rap music has driven more soothing sounds from the radio. Let's hoping some radio stations are willing to take a chance on Clay.....	1
Poor quality, the picture looks very bad. It seems as recorded with a VHS camera in the cinema. Do not recommend	0
This one of the iconic British movies from the 1950's. The story line and the cast were just magnificent. I have watched this movie many times over the years, mainly on late night television. I was surprised that the movie is still available. The story is based on true events from thne 2nd WW and this forgotten hero in one effort did a lot to help shorten the War. His father should be given more recognition for the act of selfless love in donating his Sons body to the war effort.	1
You don't have to be a fan of PT to enjoy the magnificent accomplishment of video and sound that is Anesthitize. If you're a live music fan, there's no chance that you won't marvel at the technical ability, production, and flawless playing found here. If you like PT, well....welcome to Shangri-La. The only problem with the Blu-Ray is that the viewer will be spoiled forever - no other concert video will match up!	1
[...]i said that it was good and fun but i was all wrong. the day i got it after playing with it by myself, it fell then the pet had a scratches and paint bruises (that white mark). the third day i got bored of the same three chips so i brought more, it was expensive and the chips are small. so my little sister already lost half of them (and the chips are easy to spot). the first two weeks it ran out of power, and it has their own special battery,so it was gone (also i forgot to say is the, gameplay of it was bad,and it was imposible to beat somebody with a higher level and better chips unlike yugioh). For kids (like me) don't ask to buy it ,it was hard to find some body with the pet. for parents make sure there is a x on this thing on your child's list,it won't last long (more likely for younger kids). overall to everyone should get the nintendo ds,GBA or atleat the video now thing, this pet is a waste.	0
I wore these shoes to the gym (powerlifting requires flat soles) no more than 4 times a week for 3 hours at a time. After 9 months I was sliding the heal on and the seam ripped (on the opening, between the toe and heal, inside edge).Guess I'll skip the lo top next time.	0
I bought this at christmas time and i love it. i've yet to have a problem with it. i use staples brand computer paper and don't have a problem with it. the quality pictures it prints are excellent and fast. the only complaint i would have is that there is no tray to catch the papers that just printed out so they just basically fall down all over the place. i love the wireless connection to it. i have a laptop so i'm not always in the same place, but now i can sit in my bedroom and print something out and not have to fiddle with cords and such to connect it. i recommend this.	1
Absolute waste of money. What arrived was knock off crap that smelt like petrol and was slightly greasy/slippery to the touch.I left them sitting outside their packaging for a month so see if they improved but all they did was make the area smell like them.Given the price and cost to return not worth the trouble to send back however I would never buy from these guys again.Am fairly surprised at the comments of quality etc - suggest people go and see what the real thing looks/feels/smells! like in a retail store.	0
The card isn't very good and stores pictures too slowly, especialy as you start to fill up the memory. Also SimpleTech's customer support isn't too good. Not one person could tell me what the 'Error Application' message meant when using the Simple Tech CompactFlash Card Reader to get pictures from the card.Stay away from this company.	0

While this album isn't bad, several of the songs also exist on the Everything I Need album. I own both and in my opinion, the Everything I Need versions of these songs are much better.	0

In the past I charged my 3 batteries individually with a schumacher charger. Just installed this minnkota and I am already in love. The charger is all metal with good weight. I like how it looks and really appreciate having individual lights for each battery. Compared to the competition this was a no brainer. Other brands give 1-2 year warranty or lifetime that is pro rated (with some crazy equation that almost totals the cost of this charger). This has a 3 year warranty. This is another great product from minnkota and I expect I will have it a long time.	1
I could not put this book down. Fascinating depiction of human beings struggle for survival. If you enjoyed Into Thin Air you will also enjoy this one.	1
Filled with a bunch of Chi Shmmee mystical crap. Lots of BS filler to make it to the publisher's page quota. I can summarize this book's running advice for you in two words. LEAN FORWARD.Don't waist your money.	0
"If you're truly looking for a book to ""get lost"" in, this is it. This particular edition is completely fine, no better or worse than any other, but honestly - it's all about the book itself. It's one of those stories you can read a dozen times, and still enjoy, and find something new in."	1

"in your review you said we should all start listening to ""music.""the you started bitching about the black keys being compared to the white stripes and how the white stripes play blues and only u know that because YOU listen to ""MUSIC."" the two bands should not be compared because they are completely different sounds. you see there are different types of blues and there is a difference between playing the blues and being influenced by the blues but im sure you know that because you listne to ""music"" unlike the rest of us"	1
The artwork is the only thing anyone ever remembered from this series. Congratulations on putting out an edition that looks exactly like every other scary stories for kids book, instead of the ONE that literally everyone remembers from their childhood.Great way to commemorate the anniversary.	0
"I received my ""new"" product a few days ago but it wasn't in brand new conditions. The box had been worn around the edges and you can tell it had been rewrapped in a different plastic cover. When I pay extra money for a brand new item I expect it to be exactly that."	0
Crocodile Dentist broke before the child had a chance to play the game. He simply opened the mouth to set it and it wouldn't lock open so the teeth could be played. When an adult tried to get it to set, it was obvious the racheting mechanism was faulty. Return it? No, it cost less than $10 and would cost nearly that to get it in the mail(wrapping supplies, drive time and gas to get it to the post office). We are going to chalk it up to what you get when you don't buy American.	0
"The first time I heard this song, I would easily have given it 4 stars. Great music, decent vocals...in fact, I enjoyed it a great deal. The second time I heard this song, I thought, ""Hmm...this sounds awfully familiar for some reason, but I'm not sure why."" The third time I played this song, I played ""Caribou"" by the Pixies immediately afterward and figured out where I had heard it before.This song is basically a melange of Pixies songs, primarily ""Caribou,"" grafted together and repackaged under this band's name. That said, there is nothing remotely innovative or even creative to be found here. Yes, it's a nice song, but it's basically been done already, and it's been done infinitely better.Please, I beg of you: Direct your funds to their rightful recipient by purchasing either ""Come on Pilgrim"" or ""Wave of Mutilation."" Don't waste your time on this inferior knock-off."	0
"This is the first book since ""A Night to Remember"" that actually carries you back through time to the decks of the sinking Titanic until you actually feel it yourself. You feel the emotions of the people that night - and then you are yanked forward in time to the expeditions that first discovered and explored the Titanic, and then Pellegrino moves you back and forth in time again and again from the night of the sinking to the expeditions until at last you become, like James Cameron's Rose, unstuck in time. It is easy to see how Cameron was so moved by Pellegrino's morphings through time. A reading of this scientist's other books reveals that he seems to be unable to tell a tale in linear fashion. In both ""Unearthing Atlantis"" and ""Ghosts of the Titanic,"" he unfolds archaeological investigations by telling the whole history backwards! It is difficult to imagine what he will do with time next. But I'll be there for the ride. You can bet on it."	1
This is one of my favorite movies, so was very disappointed when a format was sent that would not play on my standard DVD player. I am in the process of returning it and hopefully will be able to exchange it for the correct format so that I can enjoy it once again.	0
I ordered Jonestown PBS Home Video and had already seen the movie years ago. It was like watching the movie with him and the real people in it. Awesome job. And shipping was within days, worth the price. I would recommend this movie and buying it here!!!!!	1
"I received this air mattress and was very impressed at first. It's only been a couple of months with sporadic use by an average size/weight person and it's now unuseable. Two of the seams along the top of the mattress have now ""popped"" so that the top of the mattress is 1/2 big bulge and 1/2 normal. There's no reason this should've happened. When only 1 seam popped it was still ok, but with 2 gone we have to throw it away."	0
I really enjoyed reading this book; it is well written. It opened worlds I had no knowledge of. My father was raised in the Hood River Valley and went to school with some mentioned in this book; this is real and living history to me. My life has been forever changed.	1
I rarely write reviews, but after I received this Halloween book, if you would even like to put it in that catagory, I felt I needed to save anyone from buying it!An avid celebrater of Halloween, I thought that I had to have this boook for my collection--the title itself was SO catchy. After looking at it, the book was returned.Words cannot even describe the dissappointment I felt after glancing through it. Boring, old, uninviting, crafty suggestions. If you are looking for a good Halloween book for the not too crafty or the not too gory, games, treats, decorations, try 101 Halloween Ideas.	0
Names Marcus from Sydney,Australia.I saw Queensryche when they came 'down under'and toured in July.They were totally AWESOME live,ans so I have been following there progress on the QR website.I can now hardly wait until I can get a copy of Queensrche: Mindcrime at the Moore.I met the guys after and they were fantastic to meet,along with Pamela Moore who reprised her roll as Sister Mary.A fantastic voice in Mind crime as well as a solo artist.I hope that one day they can come back 'DOWN' with this great act.This has to be a must for any 'QR' fan........................	1
I recommend this book to all of my friends because it is very thorough and very short! This is especially helpful if the other parent isn't much of a reader (at least about child development) I highlight a few chapeters when I want my husband to understand more about what our daughter is going through.	1
If you're looking for a book to learn how to use a router, this isn't it.If you have some experiance using a router this is a great book.

Another great puzzle by Sunsout. This is the more traditional squarish design rather than the nice widescreen-sized puzzles, of which I am becoming quite fond. That is the only reason I made this a four-star review rather than a five-star. The pieces on this one, while nice with a superb amount of variety in them, are average in size, making this puzzle fragile like typical puzzles once put together.The many different blues in this puzzle are incredible and really make this a very beautiful item. There was just the right amount of difference in the shades that it was not too hard to put together. The mix of gold shades in the wisemen and the camels stand out just enough in contrast to the blues.Very good puzzle!	1

A hollywood over the hill Gay Blade,with few flicks to his producer credits except (The Bride of Frankenstein) focuses in on a handsome man gardener, exit gardening, enter modeling (with clothes on)up the ladder to modeling (with clothes off)Advances spurred and rejected, queen to swimming pool, face down.Acting and filming fairly well done. Academy award quality-definity not. Interesting story ? Well its different ?	1
I haven't been using this one very long, but so far it seems to be working great. Thankfully there is no pain. It may take longer to work than the freezing a doctor would do, so be patient. The planters warts on the bottom of my foot have been there for a long time. Thought they were calluses until my doctor told me otherwise. I started treatment as soon as I got it in the mail. So far it seems to be working great.	1
I knew nothing about struts before picking up this book. I know just a little more after having read all that I can stand of it. The book provides very little example code and what it does provide is just in little snippets that don't really help. I'm halfway through the book and I can't take any more theory without being able to get some basic examples running. I consider this book more of a reference than a learning tool. I am abandoning it in favor of a different book. If you're new to struts, look elsewhere for a good introduction.	0
This is a terrific oral history of the show. Gives you a sense of how it got off the ground, the insane competition for performers and writers to get sketches into the show, and gossipy stuff like politics, obnoxious hosts, and drug use. Reflections on the deaths of Belushi, Gilda, Farley, and Hartman are tremendously moving. I started this book at about 9:00 p.m., did not put it down until 6:30 a.m. the next morning.	1
This book is not all that hard to understand. In simple terms, Laband and McClintock tell us that we waste a lot of money trying to avoid someone else wasting our money. It's not this fact that puts the reader so off guard. The fact that our society spends about four hundred billion dollars trying to influence two trillion dollars in government expenditures (about twenty percent of the total) shows what an inefficient mess our economy has become. This fact of wasted wealth should shock the reader. I couldn't believe it at first. The amount of research used is impressive and definitive. Though Laband and McClintock don't offer any serious solutions to the drain on the economy, this volume helps shape the continuing debate about wealth transfer.	1
"This book was somewhat of a disappointment. The author started out well by describing a number of God types that are accepted by many, but don't really exist.Unfortunately, when it came to explaining the God that he thought did exist, he went straight to the ""New Testament"" of the Bible, and limited his views to a rather fundamental Christian concept. He ignored the other valid religious ideas and stuck to the ""guilty until proven innocent"" point of view of most of the Christian world. An infinite Creator/Creation cannot be understood by any limited idea, especially one that insists on taking scriptural writing literally."	0

Well I presumed nothing would top System's self depute album...I was wongs. 'Toxicity' is THE BEST heavy/rock album I have ever listened. Tracks such as ATWA and X touch an more of a sensitive side of the band, but dont worry, they keep their natural stile of playing in every track. Other tracks such as 'Arto' remind us where the band had originated from, Armenia with the insturment used 'doodook' (also originated from Armenia). This is very commendable for a foreign band to I'd recomend this album to anyone that appreciates good music.	1
"Like others I would like to voice my frustration with the paper feed mechanism. It worked fine at first but then it would say that there was no paper in the tray when of course there was lots of it. HP sent me a cleaner for it but it could only be used 3 times. When that option ran out I contacted them again and they stated they could no longer help me with the problem. Disappointing for a large company to put out such a crappy printer and I am definitely going us use reviews the next time I purchase a printer. Not sure if I trust HP anymore. Now I'm getting the ""No Scan Option"" message and it seems to be a fairly common problem also. DO NOT BUY THIS PRINTER!"	0
i took me 6 days about four hours of hard work to give you a heads-up on this case , first of all the case henges are not long enough to trip the cd-rom motor on , thier is a tiny switch under one henge the v13 playstation 2 i have has a longer henge, i used a folded piece of paper to put over the tiny switch soo that when you close the lid the cd-rom will turn on and spin.also i would like to add that the screw holes in the blue clear case are not deep enough to accomadate the old screws you will have to find shorter ones, because i learned the hard way i tried to force them in and all the screw heads rounded off because thier made of cheap china metalmake sure that you wear gloves when taking out your ps2 from you old original case your oil from you fingers will show up on it crome finish and be thier for ever i tried to clean off don't work.i looks osome when your done, no instuctions in box beware !!! i had to go online to find them.	1

"This is indeed a book of 3-line poems passing itself off as haiku. This is not harmful certainly UNLESS an unwary reader picks it up and assumes that it is, basing all future opinions of this delightful poetic form on The Haiku Year.""There are those who regard haiku as a kind of 'do your own thing' poem, and never consider its foundations. But the haiku, as soon as it goes beyond the beginner's efforts, becomes a matter incorporating traditions and established values, aesthetic and otherwise, and can not be written well outside them."" - Robert Spiess"	0
I came back to read the Amazon reviews because, after reading half of this book, I've begun to wonder when/if it's going to get good. I hate to put down a book I've started- even if it bores me- so I wanted to be reminded of how great this one is supposed to be. Now I know I'm not alone in my confusion. This book came very highly recommended, but I've just been waiting and waiting to enjoy it. I think I've gone far enough and I can return it to the library. I'm really glad I didn't buy it.	0

"Having been excited at the prospect of a gripping, historically accurate, realistic WWI film about the ""Lafayette Escadrille,"" Flyboys is a big letdown. Devoid of historical substance, second-rate acting, predictable storyline - it shouldn't come as a big surprise that this movie was a flop at the theaters.Briefly, the CGI dogfights border on the ridiculous: aircraft in 1916 were hardly capable of the acrobatics and stunts shown throughout the film. More reminiscent of Star Wars than actual flying.Also: the portrayal of the Germans is laughable....all German pilots flying bright red, Red Baron-style, Fokker Dr.I triplanes, and led by the sinister ""Black Falcon."" (!) Come on!Recommended: ""The Blue Max"""	0
This book was so completely tedious for me. It felt like half the time I was reading a not-very-interesting Wikipedia description of the first humans and their way of life, and the rest of the time I was left with poor writing and even worse dialogue. I can't believe this book was so popular .... Was there nothing to read in the '80s? I had expected something amazing, as I had heard so much about this book, but was sorely disappointed. Not recommended.	0
"Now maybe I'm just dumb, but I found this book incredibly tedious to read. I could live with the vague religion, the convoluted story line, the cheesezy references to ""old earth"", even the dense and overly decriptive paragraphs that yield little in the way of plot or character devlopment. I slogged though all that and at the end of it we find out very little about ""sam"" or what he was doing this whole time except that he is fighting a civil war againist the gods. I could go on and on, but basically don't waste your money on Lord of Light."	0
The book tells of the fascinating rise and fall of the Buendia family. It is not really all that long, never dull, and clearer than the most transparent crystal (although, taken at a deeper level, the book offers much more than what appears on the surface). In many respects, the book tells of the rise of, and predicts the fall of, humankind. In this sense, it is allegorical fiction at its finest. Along the way, it tells a cornucopia of stories about love, war, peace, remembrance, time, joy, pain, and many other emotions beyond description in this small amount of space.	1
A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy.	1

This was the first Xanth novel I ever read, but it was easy enough to get into. I wasn't too confused by reference to other Xanth novels as they were minimal and were not much focused on. Some of the jokes were rather funny, and the plot had enough humorous twists in it (and a couple of cool surprises!) to keep me well-entertained. It was a rather enjoyable book, though I definitely like Incarnations of Immortality better. overall 3.5/5 stars.	1
I have been waiting for this to come out on DVD since DVDS came out. This is my favorite show. You must buy this TV show this is the best ever. I have been watching this show since i was little. I just love John Ritter shows and movies he is so funny. I'm going to miss him. Rest in peace John.	1
Hard to find a better direct-wire wall timer of this quality. HOWEVER, this is the third one I have purchased so be warned that they will eventual ware out. The timer will eventual stop counting down and get stuck, leaving your device always on. I have mine hooked to turn off a wall heater in the bathroom. It works well for that. NOTE: Even though it will eventual ware out, they usually last a few years before they do. So yes, they are worth the price. BE WARNED: If the start waring out replace immediately as they will get stuck in the ON position... Thus, 4 stars.	1
"Is this movie a joke? A psychic guy running around in LA, killing demons with a crucifix-shaped gun. At one point, he kills a whole bunch with the aid of holy water...coming out from the sprinkler system! A Black voodoo priest called Papa Diavolo or something to that effect. Lucifer is on bad terms with his own son, named Mammon. The archangel Gabriel has a fall out with God and looses his wings. And no-no-no, you can't commit suicide, because if you do, you automatically go to Hell. Chain smoking is another sure method. And Heaven looks like...the Manhattan skyline!Once again, is this a joke?""Men in Black II"" were better."	0
I like this album a lot. There's a lot of power and swirling guitars, and the melodies just knock you flat. Enigk's soaring tenor is at its most tremendous here. Every Shining Time you Arrive is a classic, and #9, the title of which contains a dirty word, has one of the most beautiful and jarring transitions I've heard in years. Great CD.On another note, I think it's funny that a previous reviewer, Heidikakis from NY, lifted almost all of her(his?) review from pitchforkmedia.com...Why would someone do that? I'm sure that the folk at pitchforkmedia.com aren't pleased.	1
I love this book and must disagree with another customer who reviewed it saying that obviously the magazine had nothing to do with it. I know one of the featured designers, who confirmed that he was chosen by the magazine editor to appear in the book. And the long bok introduction is written by the editor in chief herself.	1

I was so thrilled when TIVO came out with this wireless adapter !! With cell phones increasingly replacing the need for a land line, TIVO hopped on the wagon. The only reason I had a land line was for my TIVO service. With the wireless adapter, I had my land line disconnected and am happy to save that monthly expense.Adapter works great and I've had no problems with it over the last 10 months or so since I purchased it.It was easy to get working !	1

I loved the slim design and the USB power so I could power it with my notebook's USB port. The software was an upgrade to the other visioneer scanners I've owned over the years, which is easy to use. However after only a few hundred scans, there's a growing progressive distortion on the left side of images as if blackened, resulting in a very poor scan. I'm throwing it away. Buy something else.	0
To start off, this movie lacks any direction, also there is no build up of excitment, no rising interest, and little or no action till the very end. I love Van-Damme movies and especially actioners of all types but I found myself desperately trying to stay awake through this. Watch this movie if you have alot of time to hopelessly squander.	0
This is the first thing I've ever gotten from under armour. Everyone on my football team has good luck with their products but mine seems to be defective. After one wash the logo starts cracking and the second time worn the logo starts peeling...wishing for a refund, bad luck I guess.	0
Can't say enough good things about Tivo. I especially like this one with the dual tuner. I had an older one with a single tuner, which sometimes required complicated logistics if I was going to have more than one show on at a time.For me, Tivo is kind of like the internet. I don't know how I ever got by without it.My only minor complaint is that the subscription fees are more than they used to be.	1
This book has been of great help to all of our victim advocates and most importantly to our clients.

This ball is made of thick and durable plastic -- seems more heavy-duty than the balls at my gym. I use it as an office chair in addition to using it for exercises. The hand pump worked fine. I followed the instructions and filled the ball half way, left it overnight and completed filling it the next day. All-total, filling the ball took only 15 minutes. They provided very clear instructions on how to measure the filled ball. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the instructions mentioned a bicycle pump needle attachment that wasn't included in my box.	1
"""Of Mice and Men"" is a lonely story of two hobos, Lennie and George. Lennie is a large man with a mental disability and a craving for soft things and George is a small man who's in charge of Lennie, making sure he isn't getting them in trouble. The men had to flee from Weed because Lennie was accused of raping a woman when he only wanted to feel her dress.They find a ranch outside of Weed and work there. There they meet a rambunctious man by the name of Curley who threatens to knock out any man's lights if they even consider looking at his jail-bait wife. Curley is the ranch owner's son so, he's never going to get into trouble. When Curley and Lennie cross paths, something terrible happens. ""Of Mice and Men"" was a very good book that we both enjoyed. Some of the hobo-dialect is a little hard to understand but pretend you're the characters (like we did) and you'll find out what a good book this is!"	1
"I was very excited to receive ""A Love Supreme"". It was shipped fast and the packaging looked good. I immediately opened it up and go to play it but alas the record was snapped in half.

Other than my boots for which I have a standing-tiered shoe rack, this shoe tree is perfect with enough room to let my 9.5 women's size shoes hang without hitting one another. It has a weighted bottom so that it doesn't fall over and I can easily use the handle on top to pull it out of my closet if I am thoroughly confused as to what pair to wear on a particular day. Definitely a must especially if you have a walk-in closet.	1
I thought this was one of the worst books I've ever read. The characters were entirely unconvincing - e.g. the professor with the strange name who can only express himself using metaphors. The plot is just a predictable and flimsy excuse for a parable about the dangers of modern society. I read it, because I'd bought it, but I found almost every word an insult to my intelligence.	0
I was really excited to rent this based on the 4 star reviews. Needless to say once I started watching it, I was bored for the first hour. Then these ridiculous looking monsters appear out of nowhere.ABSOLUTELY BORING, HARD TO SEE, and STUPID. WORST MOVIE EVER.. try Halloween orExorcist if you want a REAL horror movie.	0
I'll keep this short, I saw Fireworks and thought it was average at best, saw pieces of that kijuro or whatever its called with the little kid in it, that one was pretty good. I liked this movie alot and its the only reason I got into Takeshi Kitano movies, if I never happened to stumble accross this movie late night on Showtime or Cinemax I would have never sparked an interest. I'm not a sheep so I dont follow everyone elses opinions, and you can trust my reviews I wont say somethings good because everyone else does.Try it out, Rent or buy.	1
I have only had this product for three months, and after a month I was having problems with this product. I have given up on this vibe, and I do not recommend buying this product. Spend the extra money on something that will actually last!	0
I almost knew this thing was going to be a hunk of crap from some of the reviews... but I figured I would see for myself. Yeah, this thing doesn't even keep liquid in a mug luke warm. It is junk. At least Amazon's return policy is 100% good-to-go.	0
Gatchaman is the latest incarnation of what most people knew as G-Force. The characters are nearly identical to their 70's G-Force counterparts with a 90's look. The macha designs are excellent, the action is fast paced. The only problem is that the American voice actors didn't do justice to what was happening on the screen. I've only viewed volume 1, but so far it looks to be a great trip!	1
These shoes look great. They are very trendy and a lot of people are wearing them nowadays. The biggest problem I have with these shoes is that they hurt my feet. The soles are too flat. When I tried running in them, my heels began to hurt. Walking wise, they aren't the most comfortable to say the least. They are also heavy for what they are. Too expensive for what they are. These shoes are probably bad for your back because they don't absorb any impact. Personally, I don't recommend them for anyone.	0
For 14 months this product worked great. Then it died. It was not dropped or otherwise abused. TIVO's response was that they would replace it for the cost of buying a new one.Even though it broke so quickly, TIVO is worth the price we payed for the box and the service. If the cable companies could come out with a DVR that was as capable I would rather rent it knowing that if it broke it would be replaced for free.The box itself is rather bulky for the electronics that are actually inside it. The unit could have been designed a little better to make the overall size smaller.Hopefully you get a better box than we did.	0
This DVD has good information, but the woman is annoying. I think they could have shortened it up a little bit. It is a good alternative to going to a birthing class.	1
Talk about being disappointed! This book took a very superficial approach to some very basic concepts and the result is a book that might be useful if you are brand new to deploying servlet-based Web applications but useless if you want to learn about the nuts and bolts. I bought it to make sure that I'd know how to correctly configure Tomcat in a production environment but this book added very little to what I'd already learned from reading the documentation.	0
"About four weeks ago, I purchased at a Home Depot in Florida the Plasplugs ""Master Tiler"", model number: DWW180US-BX.I am using it for a porcelain tile installation. The original blade worked ok for the initial cuts, but I need to replace it for the proper blade type for the tile. I had bought a porcelain tile replacement blade from a blade mfr when I bought the saw. When I got around to replacing the blade, I found out that the Plasplugs machine uses a different ""arbor"" than everybody else. The replacement blade was worthless to me.I then called the Plasplugs US office to order the ""high glaze"" blade. Much to my chagrin, I was told the ""all blades except the standard have been discontinued"".I just bought this saw four weeks ago! I think it is very irresponsible for a manufacturer to behave in this matter.You can be assured that I will avoid any Plasplug product in the future."	0
I could not understand why Amazon wanted 65 bucks for just a book with no description listed, so I went to Lowes and bought it for 20 bucks. Started reading and immediately found out that every word in the book refers to the authors' protractors and other accessories which can be bought through his web site. If you only bought the book with no accessories as I did, you are pretty much out of the loop as all the pictures and examples include his products. His system may work, but why not be up front about it? Just tell us what is going on, and if you are like me and already have invested in a really good (Starrett) protractor, pass on his book and get a more straightforward guide to installing trim.I also agree with others who think the reviews are fishy. Amazon, you really dropped the ball on this one, with no details on the product.By the way, I took the book back.	0
Diapers are Pampers, so they work as well as any diaper. Except, that I prefer Safeway brand diapers because they hold overnight and are slightly bigger than Pampers. But, the price is comparable to Amazon.com. Delivery, on the other hand was horrible! Box was totally ripped, torn and almost all the diapers were exposed. Deivery by UPS and I took a pic. Very disappointed Amazon didn't put box into another to protect the cheap box the diapers are orginiall packaged in.	0
The book which is a kind of a sequel to an epochmaking book by Alec Wilder is simply indispensable to anyone who is interested in the field. It is both intelligent and entertaining, as a book on popular music should be. Highly recommended.	1
"I've owned this CD for a few years, yet thought something was slightly off, so I compared ""Keep A Knockin"" to another copy I have.Results:Original is 168 beats per minutes, while this version is 172 beats per minute.Original's time is 2 min. 23 seconds; this version is 2:16 min."	0
This is a wonderful DVD to watch, especially for those who are having their first child. I watched this before my son was born, and had a completely natural birth because of it. This was MUCH better than the birthing class that we took at our local hospital. The woman who presents the information is a little goofy, but there is a lot of helpful information here!	1
I grew up with this movie and was happy to find in on a DVD. Glad to be able to get it at a good price	1

Viewsonic customer service is nonexistent and product support worse than poor. Products are poorly made and will not last. Call technical support 1800-688-6688 and see how long you have to wait for a service rep. Online you get someone to respond who barely speaks English. I bought a plasma TV for $3000 and it failed in less than 3 years. Viewsonic reaction: Too bad, you should have bought a warranty and we'll fix it in 48 hours. Without one, you are on your own. I think something bought for $3000 should last more than 3 years, and Viewsonic should too. Viewsonic intentionally builds products that won't last to sell you an expensive product warranty. I wouldn't buy Viewsonic again and don't think you should either until they built a better product and improve their customer support.	0
My 5 month old never had diaper rash until she started using the Pampers baby dry (size 1) she doesn't even sleep for more than 4 hours at a time so she never sat in a diaper for much longer than that. I would never buy these again. In fact, we have tons leftover and I'd rather waste the money than subject my baby to them.	0
"I get that they want a standard for fitness classes, but if you dance the techniques correctly it is a workout. But just to move quickly with poor form is crazy. The more precise the movements especially the figure 8 movements the more tone on gets. The hands are ""Sloppy"" and the arms are dead weight. Shoulders are not kept away from the ears correctly. I just think you are better off buying a technique dvd with a dancer of professional performance status and drill the sequences.I found the transitions, sequencing, foot patterns and overall energy ""Sloppy"""	0

To make this as quick and as painless as possible, the movie was a huge letdown. Keanu Reeves look like he was just going though the motions here and delivers a rather stale performance that is the worse one in the entire film and that's a great feet considering that Shia LaBeouf, gives a painfully unfunny performance as his pet sidekick. Rachel Weisz is great but she's stuck with Keanu way too much and she would have been much lead than he was because she at least made you care about what was happening with the film while Keanu was just playing his Neo character again. Djmon Hounsou is fine but wasted in a bit part and Peter Stormare is criminally underused in a cameo.The special effects are great but there is really no story to be told and the script is pretty bad in some parts.Avoid.	0
This cd is nothing but talentless crap, the only good song is sick little suicides, the rest of the cd is no more then a joke, they try to be like NOFX and they cannot pull it off at all, they suck so much ass, i hate this band and would never support the shows they play or them for that matter, crap crap crap is the best way to describe this cd!!!	0
Despite Dorian Hawkmoon's best efforts, the Dark Empire is still expanding. It is growing so much he has to take extraodinary efforts to protect his own turf.

Hey,Jake here. I've watch all the Megaman series from the time I was 6. When the new Megaman NT Worrior series came out I had to watch at least one episode. After that I was hooked. Ever since then I've been waiting for a PET to come out. This toy is the coolest. It lookes exactly like the ones on the show. The battle chips are great too. The only thing I can say is bad is that it olny comes with three chips and as of now there is no way of getting any, unless u buy a figure (...), you can get 1 battle chip per figure. Other than that this is one of the best toys I've seen in a while.	1

"For my English class, I read Charles Dickens' ""Hard Times."" I chose this book because I have read several of Dickens' works, and I have enjoyed them. I find his works good, thought-provoking books that are free of cuss words, violence, and lusts. I think this book was a realistic account of what life was like in the early nineteen hundreds. I was glad that Mr. Gragrind came around in his thinking and realized it is okay to have fun. I am also glad of how the book ended. I was glad to see that justice was preserved. Overall, I think this is a good book, and I would suggest that you read it. I enjoyed it."	1
Maybe the first book about which I can honestly say , I couldn't put it down! The way the story unfolds and resonates with the gospel of salvation through Jesus Christ is remarkable!	1

There must be an explanation for why Time Warner Cable chose her to do their commercials, but I just don't get it. Her voice is like fingernails on a chalkboard to me. I've seen drunk karaoke singers sing better than her. She is everything that is wrong with the music business today - record companies will promote these no-talent artists in advertising, pay off Clear Channel (who owns 90+% of all radio stations) to spin their records, and true artists are left behind. I bet the hair on Mick Jagger's neck stands up when he thinks of his classic tune being butchered by this nobody in those annoying commercials.	0
My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends.	1
"Another dark, gloomy, mildly confusing, Blade Runner-ishview of the future lacking in any redeeming qualities.""In the future, Firemen burn books"" -- Bradbury createsan inventive premise but his own gloom overtakes the story.Fraught with loose ends, this is the last book you readbefore you set yourself on fire."	0
In Movieland, some people are just born for certain parts. This was a Jeffrey Combs/Barbara Crampton movie if there ever was one. All it lacked was Jeffrey Combs and Barbara Crampton. This was not a good movie by any stretch of the imagination unless you are satisfied with the sexy blonde in the black underwear on the bed for a photo session. She was sexy but not sympathetic. The ending was ...well, what were they doing? The heroine was bashing in the skull of a person who obviously was no where near her from the angle of the camera shot and where she was swinging. Anyway, the movie was pretty bad. So bad in fact, I immediately again watched Reanimator and From Beyond, both with Jeffrey and Barbara, then I watched Death Bed again...I hate to admit it...I might watch it a third time. Oh, and Joe Estavez...Talk about unintentionally hilarious!!!.	0
The acting was good for what it was. The opinion I have after watching it was the movie was someone's spoof of what BDSM was. The ending just left me with my mouth hanging open and shaking my head in wonderment.	0
This is the sappiest, most poorly written, manipulative crap I've ever read. It somehow redefines the laws of mediocrity. The story is cliched and contrived. The characters are like cardboard. The love story is perverted and it celbrates a young girl's ignorance. This is a bonafide chick book. If you are a guy click the back button on your browser and walk away. If not well maybe you might like it but that still doesn't make it good.	0
I bought these after reading tons of reviews and not realizing the HUGE difference between the Baby Dry and Swaddlers or the Sensitive Pampers. The Baby Dry ones are horrible! They are rough and hard and do not stretch AT ALL, not to mention my son poops up the back of them about every other day. So if you are debating between these and swaddlers/sentive pampers go with one of those they are so much more absorbent and softer!	0
this is a different kind of movie and I love it. so very glad I found and ordered it. it's amazing. this came securely wrapped, great delivery, and quality dvd satisfied with service, and movie	1
I bought a pair of these to replace similar hoses in my 5'er. The came on time, were well packaged, and work exactly as they should work. I had a tiny leak in one of the originals, and so replaced the pair. Very happy with the results.	1
My only regret is that it ends. Once I entered the rich world created by Zelazny, I never wanted to leave. I have read and re-read this masterpiece of science fiction, and my time has always been well rewarded. But I can't help envying any person who had the chance to read it for the first time. Just as the Tolkien's Lord of the Rings, Asimov's I, Robot, Gibson's Neuromancer, Card's Ender's Game and other works were ground-breaking works in the genre, Lord of Light is a timeless classic that must be on the shelf of any SF lover.	1
I intended to use this TiVo with an AT&T Uverse system....Although it was advertised to work(by TiVo) and I got the model that they recommended...it would only receive one channel and about 20% of the time when it tried to record, it would not be able to effectively change to the correct channel.	0
"I'm getting very angry at some of these companies that are releasing very poor Quality DVDs.""I'd Give My Life"" could have been very enjoyable if they spent a little time fixing it up. In some areas the movie goes dark and light and dark and light. It gets very annoying. There's crackle and popping sounds through out the movie."	0
i buy this one with other four books on 11/12/2008.i still don't recieve this one now.but i have recieved other four books two weeks ago.by asking support why? they let me wait untill January 13, 2008.this is weird.i am in china	0
This was an enjoyable film that I would not have seen if I hadn't suscribed to Amazon Prime. I'm not getting any perks, etc, for reccomending Amazon Prime, but one of the features is the instant video. While many films have a rental fee, this film was included and I would not have watched it without that incentive.I found the plot of this film rather predictable, but the acting was good. I haven't seen many Danish films so it was interesting to me on a cultural level. The scenery wasn't a huge part of the film, but it showed some lovely aspects of Copenhagen. I did enjoy the film and would suggest it to people wanting a thoughtful film somewhat in the vein ofThe Descendants.	1
"The description on the website says it has an 11-inch dome, that's why I was willing to pay the high premium for the cake stand. But when it arrived I carefully measured the dome and it was only 10-inches. You can get a 10-inch one and it cost LESS THAN HALF as much (search ""diner cake stand""). DON'T FALL FOR IT!"	0
If you like romantic movies, this is the perfect one for you. But, please don't cry! It was a gift for someone else, eventhough I personally had seen it. It arrived just in time and I could keep track (via UPS) where it was, since I purchased it being in Puerto Rico.	1
The worst item I have ever purchased it is so flimsy you can only fill it to half full putting it together nut and screws stripped out and had to go to ace hardware to buy new bolts and nuts save your money	0
I saw this movie twice in theaters it was the best animated movie ever!I liked it more then the incredibles.Actuly I don't like it I love it!!!!!	1
Wow, pinch me is it really 2011 and we still have consumer electronics catching fire? Where is CE, UL, BS when you need them?Fortuitously I was next to the amp when the wisps of smoke started, followed by a crackling fire. The amp as spec'ed is decent and worked fine - until it decided to self-combust. The real concern is that this is configured as an 'auto-on' device, so it switches itself on when it receives an audio signal on the line-in: this means it is often going to be put somewhere out of the way and unnoticed - and that makes it a REAL fire hazard (as in 'burning the house down' hazard).So if i could give is a zero or negative star it would be duly awarded. Since now at least three reviews have indicated there is a real fire hazard, Amazon need to look carefully at what they are offering.	0
was not sure if it would have fit, but it did as i have a chassis form the f50.8 version. Thus far it feels good and i would definately recommend the use of this product	1
To be completely honest, I have only examined the sample for this e-text of Romeo and Juliet. It was a very unhelpful sample, giving a selection of the introductory essay about Shakespeare's life and times.So I scoured the review page. None of the reviews I looked at are actually for the e-version of this book. They were written for a variety of paper versions of the book, good, bad, and ugly. Some are about a specific used book purchased, others are about the play itself (love it/hate it). None of them help determine the value of this specific e-version of the play.Bottom line, I refuse to pay $4.99 for a version that I can't get any information about. How does it look on the page? Are there additional annotations beyond the essay about Shakespeare's life and times? Are there links to acts or scenes? Are there line numbers?	0
one of finlands best kept secrets.this cd is full of power. tarja turunen vocals are just stunning.from the haunting song a dead boys poem to the powerfull she is my sin and crownless this cd is for any one who is into great euro metal a must.	1
I was really looking forward to this one. As a fan of the Classic Album Series, I was very disappointed when I watched this one. The volume level is very inconsistent, especially during the sections where people are talking over the music. You have to turn it way up when they're talking, then be quick with the remote when the music starts or it will blow your speakers! For die-hard fans only, and keep the volume remote handy. You'll need it!	0
Have this movie ever been made in region 4 format also. I believe that I would be great to be seen again.	0
Horrifying and haunting short stories illustrated with mentally disturbing sketches. I used to pull this book out at slumber parties and we'd all freak ourselves out. I still remember some of the short stories to this day.	1
I am very happy that I purchased this rice cooker.It is easy to use ,brainless- just add water,rice and forget about. It is extremely convenient and makes excellent rice. Guests have asked how we cooked the rice because it was perfect.	0
"I went to a granddaughter's birthday party today with my wife. The other grandparents were there, other people as well, kids and grownups both. Someone started playing with the Q20 and it passed from one person to another. One of my grandkids thought ""toilet"" and it guessed right away correctly. This is a great little novelty item. I see that it's out of stock now at Amazon. Backorder it or snatch it up wherever you see it as a stockting stuffer."	1
If there is one book that you read in high school that you should read again later in life, this is it. In fact, I'm inclined to think that it shouldn't be taught until at least college because there is simply no way that any child in high school can truely appreciate this amazing novel. Whether you hated it or loved it when you read it in high school, or even if you didn't read it in high school, it is an outstanding story and Bradbury's writing is as smooth and clean as always.	1
buena guia, la recomiendo para el uso outdoor,, mucha versatilidad y variedad en amarres . gracias, recomiendo perfectamente el producto, saludos	1
I really liked this book,especially the fact [SLIGHT SPIOLER] That you get to see different people's perspectives at different periods of time. [END OF SPIOLER] I would reccomend this to anyone who likes books by Isaac Asimov or a story that takes place over a long time. ****	1
This book was very fun to read and very spiritually uplifting. I enjoyed it from beginning to end! It was an excellent choice.	1
Great little knot guide! Good illustrations and directions are included. Nice small pocket size or put it in your workshop...	1
The fact that this book is about Titanic (well sort of anyway). This book is not a true work of history. The research is faulty, the words and thoughts of the various characters is bogus fiction. After being a student of Titanic history for almost 40 years, this is a book that I have dismissed lightly, very lightly. If you want to know Titanic and the disaster that befell her, this is not the book.	0
Great Gift Great Value - I had to get one for myself. The glasses are over sized and the shaker stirs up a great batch of dry Martini's. I love the retro glass look and the shaker has a seal to prevent leaking while shaking your favorite drink.	1
To echo the other reviews, it will only keep a warm cup warm, it will not warm up a cold cup. I am certain that the manufacturers are afraid of getting sued and don't want to make a warmer that gets reaches higher temperatures. In spite of this one drawback I use this warmer everyday - I have one at home and one at work and they consistently meet my expectations. I would recommend plugging it into a timer outlet that you program to turn off at times you know you won't be around.	1
"I own all of Amy Grant's other CD's and this is the worst! This album is so depressing, it makes sense when you realize that her marriage was on the rocks at the time. I find it amusing that she puts out one of her worst albums ever and her ex-husband (Gary Chapman) puts out one of his best. It seems like she is trying to break out of the ""Gospel & Pop"" mold that made her. I bet she does country (with Vince Gill) next."	0
"OK. I picked this up as a light weekend read, not expecting ""War and Peace"" but something fun.This book was as trite as a 1970s Harlequin romance. By the end of the first chapter, I had predicted the character development and plot twists to the very last page. The characters were horribly stereotypical and one-dimenensional. The ""nice girl"", the evil vengenful ""psycho-girl"", the ""I've having an affair with a married man and want some permanence in my life, girl"", the ""torn between job vs family girl""..I could go on forever...The only thing that kept me reading to the end was to find out if my predictions panned out.Also any author who uses the word ""frission"" twice in 10 pages should be locked in a room and required to read Strunk's ""Elements of Style"" until they learn to write beyond a 10 grade level.All in all a waste of my time and the author's."	0
I bought one of these and have been using it everyday for several years. Yes, you have to start with hot coffee, but hooray, coffee stays nicely hot for the duration. I dropped it several times over the time I've had it, and though it still works fine, the plastic is cracked and I worry that it may short out, so I bought a new one. I didn't even think of shopping around, definitely was happy with it. It looks fine too, and the cord is long enough to get under a desk (about 5+ feet).	1
Bad, bad, stupendously awful! Really bites the big one. That's probably what Leonard Pinth Garnell (sp?) would have said on the old Sat. Night Live show. What a big disappointment this film was. We are huge fans of the original, and went to see it with high hopes. It seems that most of the rest of the viewers felt the same way; people were restless, chatting and getting up to get more snacks. When Owen Wilson lost his head, instead of screams, the theater filled with sardonic laughter. Neeson phoned his performance in, Lili Taylor was wasted, and Zeta-Jones, well, as an actress, she is very pretty.	0
To put it bluntly... I hate this CD. I thought I would like it because I fell head over heels in love with Cirrus' Counterfeit CD. I listened to that CD for a week straight I loved it so much... then I got this CD. It's like a tribute to bad... BAD... 80's music. Not to bash on the people who actually like this CD but if you listen to Counterfeit first and then go to this one... you will be very dissapointed. It's one of the few CDs of mine that I would love to just toss in the trash and I rarely get a CD that I hate. It was worth all of the 69 cents I paid for it on Amazon.	0
I picked this up second hand a couple of weeks ago and I would have been happier to leave it behind. This sounds like a album that producers decided to off load there average beats to, to cash in on some extra doe. Now I dont look at raps as being the issue on rap albums as the raps should only be taken in as an over throw to the beats. The west coast is all about the groove of the music and the rappers slicking there rhymes over the top in mesmeration to these beats. How any of the rappers that feature on this album does this beats me or are they like the producers just cashing in. The good tracks as few as they are on this arnt even that worth repetitive listens. Sorry Bad Azz but if your style incourages beats like this then your crossed off my list.	0
I am a great fan of Jane Kurtz.The Feverbirds Claw was a very good book.It tought you things like,You can make friends with someone who is different,don't judge them for how they look, to be a good friend no matter what,and that you can face you fears on matter how scarey,how hard they look and seem. This is a good book that I think a lot of young readers will really like	1
After reading the book, my husband and I will take Danny Dreyer's class this year. Sounds very intriguing!	1
"I don't like this book very much. This is the most boring book I have ever read. I will not recommend this book to my friends because it's boring. ""Fahrenheit 451"" is about Guy Montag, a fireman, who starts fire but does not putout fires. In this society, the fireman has to set up fires and burn the books. Usually when we hear ""fireman"", we always think about that their job is to put out fires. It is totally different than we thought, right? This book is about censorship, that is, people does not have the right to read. In that society, the firemen have the rights to burn. Not only books, but also the houses and people. In this book, an innocent woman who has being burn in her house with her books. How can the fireman has the right to burn a human life, a human life! Especially a book lover, How?"	0
This book is confusing, it jumps around to much, to many generations in the book. I could not understand this book at all.	0

First airbed I received had a leak, sent it back and got the next one within 4 days. Super convenient to have the built in electric pump and super fast to inflate. Takes a bit of an effort to deflate, but that is expected for pretty much any airbed.	1
I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class.	0
I am a developer with 8 years experience but novice to Network programming. A friend suggested this book as a first and default one to start with. I am completely disappointed. It's not a practical, jump-into it, internet-age book. Let me see if it serves any purpose as a reference. BTW, the CD is totally useless. It has only a few files which you can anyway download for free.	0
This book promotes everything that a woman should not be: stupid and submissive. I am sad for Gillian, I am totally repulsed by Broderick - a possessive and rude pig, and I am bored by the book that reaks of a day-time soap (you know what is going to happen 10 pages in advance). I am sorry, Ms. Garwood if this is an ideal love for you for it surely seems like an abuse to me. I am truely sad that women still find books like that exciting and interesting.	0
I read several of the reviews before buying and kept in mind several of the recommendations. I actually ordered 2 thinking to give one as a stocking stuffer and keep one for myself. I tried the first one and it basically didn't work from the get go (broken I guess). So didn't give the other one as a gift, kept it (didn't want to give a bad gift). Finally got around to trying the second one out... put a steaming cup of hot tea on it, probably drank half the cup pretty quickly but the second half sat there for quite a while and when I went to drink it, COLD. I hate to say it but I would not recommend it.	0
good price, but stupid shippingthey couldn't deliver this item, and the order returned.they refunded only part of money and i paid and i lost all saved money of online order because of this unexpected returnyou should be careful when ordering something online	0
The squeem waist cincher was GREAT for about three weeks it does exsactly what it says until the wire that supports the squeem started to come out and the other wire broke on the other side and the squeem started To crease in the waist and stretch out turning it into the scream ! i would say if you get this product it's best to buy two of them so you could switch off and it wouldn't damage as fast but for the three weeks that I had it I was very happy I am going to buy it again but this time I'll get two of them	1
The unit I received is full of scratches on the surface. I am not sure if it's a brand new unit or not. since it works fine I just didn't bother to exchange for another one.	0
This book is a complete waste of money. It contains no information that a reasonably intelligent man (or woman) couldn't easily figure out on his or her own, or discover on internet dating sites for free. The authors are believers in astrology, and devote a substantial chunk of the book to providing astrological information. As you can probably tell, I do not believe in astrology, but despite that, the astrological information in the book would also be very quickly available at no cost to any minimally proficient Google user.	0
It is very good but it is becoming little expoensive at amazon as compared to other brands available at stores like costco.	1
I bought this item based on reviews and i have been happy with my purchases doing it this way. The stainless steel frothing pitcher is very nice. I find it is the right size for a 16 oz coffee drink. I noticed the construction is very sturdy and it is a nice weight. Not at all cheap. i would highly recommend this product.	1
Boring, boring, boring. My g/f (a Nirvana fan) and I watched this film together on a Sunday afternoon. Please save your time and money, do not watch this film.	0
"I cannot recommend this tool. When I first used it, I couldn't cut the tile. I then noticed the blade was spinning backwards! When I turned the saw off, and then on again, the blade didn't spin at all. Finally, I realized that I had to ""spin"" the blade manually as I switched on the saw to get it to turn correctly. Not what I expected from a $[$$$] tool. Once I finally got it working, I was still disappointed with the performance. Cutting was very slow, and not very accurate. ..."	0
We've tried close to every brand of diaper available - even store brands. We've had a lot of success with Pampers diapers. Our daughter is tall for her age and has a longer torso. With some diapers it is difficult to find one that fits high enough, preventing leaks. These seem to fit her well, no leaks! Also, for as thin as they are, they seem to be very aborbent.We had been using Costco's Kirkland brand diapers because they were a good value diaper, and were not unhappy with them. However, after I enrolled in the 'Amazon Mom' program, I am able to get these diapers shipped to my door on the schedule I choose, free shipping, for less than I was able to buy the same quantity of Costco's brand. Impressive! We're able to get a quality, brand-name diaper at a big-box-store price.Since enrolling in the program, we have switched back to Pampers and are very pleased!	1
What a beautiful picture than I thought before buying this. No computer image, no sfx, natural good old film. I love this film.	1
I read this book last month....should have read it while an adolescent.Setting is pre-Depression era about the struggles of the American 'family', some born in country, others immigrants or first generation. You gain a tremdous appreciation for what we have now, AND on so many levels. Social stigmas related to accepting 'charity', the cruelty of those with money against those 'without' and the sheer STRENGTH of the human spirit when facing adversity. THis book led me to examine my own reality and realize how fortunate I am to have all that I do.	1
"The product description on this item says that it fits 8-18lbs. But, if you look on the box it says ""Up to 15 lbs."" Otherwise, these are great diapers at an affordable price!"	1
"It is hardly worth commenting on the quality of the film, in this case, since the DVD is so terrible. The packaging states that the film is ""restored and enhanced"". Baloney. It also claims that the DVD contains a whole heap of special features. Double baloney. It contains none, not even an interactive menu. The sound and vision are probably as bad as I have ever seen on a DVD. You can watch this film on You Tube and enjoy better quality. Amazon should not be peddling such rubbish."	0
"This is another DM cd with a lot of big hits on it such as ""Never let me down again"" and ""Strangelove"". I don't think it's the best Depeche Mode cd but it is definately one that you'll enjoy if you are familiar with the band."	1
"You have got to be kidding me with the earlier reviews. this movie was very good. It's not Oscar winning but entertaining to say the least. This movie provides interesting storyline and great special effects. I don't really think it was set out to be some ""exorcist"" type horror film. Whatever you do watch it. It's more than worth it."	1
"This book is so good a great Canadain band called the Tea Party wrote a whole album about it called ""Transmission"". Pick up the book and the CD. They both rock and are a mindasul"	1
Hmmmm, as a veteran of Tomb raider and an someone who plays most of the 1st person shooters that appear I was quite disappointed in the game controls. The story is great, the graphics are much better then previous Tomb Raider releases but the controls ruined the game for me. One would think with all the 1st person shooters with very precise and smooth controls Tomb Raider would have them too, not so. It is very frustrating to try and play a very well done story only to continually die for lack of the ability to accurately control Lara's movement. I hope Edios learns from this experience.	0
Movie was great! The Amazon streaming was horrible. Several times the movie would stop to buffer but wouldn't restart on it's own. Several times we had back up and and restart the movie. Picture quality was good but streaming compared to NetFlix, Hulu etc. Amazon has a long ways to go before I'll buy another movie through your system.	0
Interesting and a very informative story about how the Cave people survived. The writing was somewhat elementary and repetitive but with a good plot. I would not read the second book in the series.	1
This is a great sequel to Into The Wilderness, just slightly weaker. Being with these characters is delightful. Sara Donati writes smooth and forms great visuals with her choice of words. I highly recommend this book.	1
I first heard Depeche Mode when Violator came out and decided to buy previous albums. This one, by far, is one of the best! 101 is another great album. Strangelove, Little 15, I want you know are all awesome songs! I can hear any Depeche Mode song and go back to my high school years! I was totally in love with David!	1
"Ordered this for my wife's birthday. was disappointed as the container was totally different. i ordered COTY VANILLA FIELDS COLOGNE SPRAY FOR WOMEN, 1 Once... was shipped ""VANILLA FIELDS BY COTY COLOGNE SPRAY 1 Oz"". In other words same product different container and slightly less expensive, although we were charged the full amount. Not enough difference to go thru the hassle of returning it.."	0
This is a genuine classic in Jazz, sure, but, this is a powerful spiritual statement of free-spirited unbridled but constructive passion, as you can tell by the title, A Love Supreme. Everyone gets their own values and benefits from well done art, and this is one of those artistic values... So, I end this review here with.. A Love Supreme... A Love Supreme... A Love Supreme... (As was chanted on the CD/Vinyl Album Recording)Captain Josh.	1
I recently reviewed Kathy Reichs' first book and thought it was bad, very bad actually. But because Kay Scarpetta's new one wasn't out yet, I read this one. Again we see our heroine Tempest going through a load of cases, connecting them and saving them. Cool. What Mrs. Reich did better this time: the case is more believable than in the first book. But still: the character is pretty flat, the relationship of the protagonists is way off the standard we came to love with Patricia Cornwell, especially Mother & Daugther. BTW: I knew before I opened the book that Tempest would get a kick over the head after leaving a something. And, yessss for three points, she did. I fought through to the end and then threw the book around the room because I hated myself for reading that far. Spare yourself this one.	0
I have experiences in many martial arts and had done lots of streetfighting, and I can tell a working technique just by looking at pictures. In this sense, I must say that 75% of Prof. Kirby's moves works well. His armlocks, for example, are more effective than those of Aikido. However, being an experienced groundfighter, I must say that his ground escapes are weak. But it's not his fault. I'm sure he included it just as an afterthought, and GF were not popular by the time he wrote this book. It's very good that he included it on this book, considering that most other Jujitsu teachers omits ground moves on their books.	1
The book 1984 by George Orwell, was a great book if you are into Sci Fi/adventure novels. The only part of the book I did not like was the ending. Winston sells out. Through the whole book he has you believe he secretly wants to disobey and rebell against this opressive leadership, but then at the end instead of taking the cruel death with pain and honor he sells out. He takes the easy road. It almost makes it seam like the whole book was for nothing. He ended right where he started off. Other than the sell out ending, the book kept my attention and gets a rating of 4 out of 6 on the Rob scale.	1
This is the first novel by Belva Plain I have read and I can say without hesitation it will be my last. I found the entire premise to be nothing short of silly (how many mothers would give up their children based on their supposed involvement in an accidental fire?) The plot was laughable and the main character pathetic. Sorry I wasted my time on this one.	0
While visiting Quebec City, I heard her CD playing in a clothing store. I asked who the artist was, walked to the music store down the street and bought it. If you like Jewel, Tori Amos, Alanis Morisette, etc. you'll LOVE this. I'm now buying several more through amazon.com for my sister and a couple friends for X-mas because they heard my CD and LOVED it. Can't find it in any US stores...yet! It's mainly in French, but her voice and the music is so good, it doesn't matter.	1
A dog-eared copy of this book was read over and over at our house when I was growing up. My mom, an elementary school teacher, used to read it to her class every year. I have since purchased two used paperback versions of the book for my grandchildren, and I'm so happy to see it is being reprinted. I highly recommend this book for adults and children. It's a one-evening read for an adult, but I promise you will enjoy it.	1
"This is the sexiest album ever.There's no stopping this man. He shows the freaky and beautiful side of sex. with the opening track ""TP-2"" and the pulse racing ""R&B Thug"" then the beautiful,sweet, and melodic "" The greatest sex"" and the hot and sexy ""Like a real freak."" He also gives you a song of remembrance for love ones that were lost with "" I wish"" and ""To all the homies that were lost ( I wish remix)"". From there he takes you right back into freaky mode with the famous hit "" feelin on yo booty"". He ends the album with the uplifting "" The storm is over now."" This album will most definitely take you on a journey. the journey begans with having a freaky good time, to making love, to mourning those who were lost, to grinding on the dance floor then to giving you hope and inspriation.this is one of the greatest R&B albums ever made..."	1
How refreshing it is to hear someone sing BIG again! While there are some uncomfortable moments on the album, Clay has definitely shown us what he has to offer the music world. One can't help but feel the urge to grab up some Steve Perry/Journey albums after listening to this. We haven't heard a male voice this soulful since Captain Big Voice (Perry) left the scene. Hopefully this is just the tip of the iceberg.	1
The Stendhal Syndrome is an effective, stylish thriller from horror maestro Dario Argento. The film alone would rate at least 4 (out of 5 stars) but the Troma DVD is pretty appalling. The audio is hissy and the volume low and the picture is incorrectly letterboxed and riddled with digital artifacts. If the DVD weren't bad enough it's made even worse by having a horrible, embarrassing introduction and foolish, faux interviews with Troma president Lloyd Kaufman. A good film is severely cheapened by a poor presentation. A big, fat ZERO for the disc. Hopefully, Blue Undergroud or Anchor Bay or Mondo Macabro will be able to obtain the rights soon and do this film justice.	0
I happened upon this product at Nordstrom's Rack and picked up one. Boy did I wish I had grabbed a handful. I have been buying Origin's automatic lip liner for about $22.00 a pop and these are just as good, if not better. On a lark I searched Amazon to see if they had them. Yep! I use the Black Berry as I like to wear dark and wine colored lipsticks. I am going to grab a handful this time. The liner goes on easily and keeps my lipstick in place. Makes a nice frame for the lipstick.	1
The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system.	1
"If you are looking for a fast read that is not ""fluff,"" but intellectual and well-written, then pick up a copy of In the Heart of the Sea. I bought the book based upon its topic and the fact that it had won the Book Award, not based upon any interest in the history of whaling or Nantucket. But I left the book feeling that I had ventured into a little part of the past that I would still care to know more about. It's also a great book to read along with Shackelton's story in the book entitlted South. The two books showcase vastly differing outcomes that resulted from decisions made in the face of tragedy at sea."	1
This is my second pair of Fiskar multi-purpose scissors. I got the first pair 6 years ago and used them constantly in my art studio for all kinds of cutting. They worked perfectly until I accidentally stepped on them. These scissors are extremely comfortable, stay sharper than the traditional kind, and work beautifully.	1
I really think the rest of the band don't think much of this album. There are only three good songs here: Under Pressure, Las Palabras De Amor and Back Chat. The other songs are forgettable.	0
I love Brett Helquist. His illustrations for A Series of Unfortunate Events, for example, are wonderful. However, his work does not belong here. Stephen Gammell's illustrations are really what made these books the classics that they are (no offense meant to Alvin Shwartz). I will be looking for copies with the proper illustrations as soon as I can find them.	0
I really wanted to like this book. After a good friend suggested it I decided to give it a go. Big mistake. This book put me to sleep, literally. The description of the land and plant life goes on forever. Takes way to long to get to the plot and it's just not worth the time.	0
Just Wonderful!!! My wife Loves IT! No more overcooked or burned rice...and no more pots of water boiling over and messing up stove...Rice Cooker Heaven....	1
"Have always liked Clay Aiken, but the songs and Clay's singing style all sound the same. It is an extremely non-versatile and very boring effort. Compared to Kelly Clarkson excellent Thankful CD, Clay himself should be ""thankful"" that his fans helped him debut at #1. ""Measure of a Man"" is truly a disappointing CD."	0
Un clasico, muy bien editado. Un precio muy bueno, para la calidad de su contenido. Para quien no conoce a Barthes, esta seria una buena introducci√≥n a su trabajo.	1
I can't say I actually watched this movie. I bought it as a present for my Dad for Christmas this year. He was featured as an extra in the movie. At the time, he was stationed at RAF Mildenhall, UK in the U.S. Air Force. I was just a baby when this film was shot, so it was nice to find the part where he was featured, pause it, and look in awe that he was actually on screen!	1
Most OTC wart removal products from your drug store are 17% salicylic acid (the active agent). This is 40% and the difference is noticable.You do need patience. I put a generous dab on my wart(s), daily if I can remember, and then cover with a band aid to prevent my clothes from rubbing it off. Some warts take a week or so before falling off and some much longer. I am just rid of one which took over a month. Did I mention you need patience?I suspect the OTC stuff would work too; it would just take a *lot* longer.	1
The most uncomfortable, overpriced piece of foam on the market. Also beware that there is a 10 day return policy on this piece of junk.	0
This is a book where the author tells about his own expirience on self therapy in order to accept the fact that he isn't as good as he would like to be in his professional area (despite he thinks he is teaching how to run a good life - i.e. finding hapiness despite you don't have the recognition that you would like in your professional area). Perhaps it can be helpful for someone who doesen't have a grate consciousness about him/herself and/or face the same problem of the author.	0
The chase for Lord Lucan was beyond unbelievable. It seems like everywhere they turned, Lucky appeared as if the story took place in the confines of Bermuda ... not Scotland, London, Paris and Africa.Secondly, Lucky having a double made little sense. I failed to see the upside of Lucky having a double ...can you imagine all the effort and repair that went into building that ruse? Clearly, the double was an unsustainable burden from the start (no wonder Lucky wanted him dead).Yes it's a satire ...but that doesn't allow for utter contrivances. This books only saving grace is its brevity. Given it's blatant shortcomings, I hope the positives the book has garnered here are not token. That's the problem with reviews that lack impartiality... one can never be sure of an accurate review.	0
This was the worst product I ever bought. It held up only about 40 days and then, got more inflated on one side then the other. Of course ended in the trash. I have no car, so was very hard for me to return the item, and go to the post office. Waste of money. Do not order from this company ever. BAD PRODUCTS !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	0
I can't understand how Manhattan Transfer gets all those studio musicians to play on their albums. I mean, it just makes their singing sound worse against the best drumming (Steve Gadd), bass playing and sax playing in the world. The two stars are for Kafka and the studio musicians only.	0
Yes it's pricey but so worth it! I probably have spent this much over the years for cheap ones.Our 24yr old son requested this for Christmas and he LOVES it. I decided to get one for myself after his recommendation. No regrets	1
"This book is a terrific read! I picked it up and had difficulty putting it down. Karon Goodman is right on with her sense of humor and advice on how to spend your time while in God's ""waiting room"". Patience is not a strong point for me and I'll be darned if Goodman didn't describe me to a ""T"" while speaking of herself! Definitely a must read for those Thomas' out there!!"	1
Over the winter, i seem to gain alot of weight. As a high school quarterback, that is not acceptable. Last summer, i think i went from 160 to 150. That's my gross weight loss. I'm not even talking about how much fat i lost. I gained a good amount of muscle over the summer, so i probably lost over 15 lbs of fat. I got my six pack back, and life was great. After the season, i just quit, and now my six pack is back in the fridge. I'll probably order some up next week and start again. These are great, and the results are amazing.	1
Bought this to take two bikes on a road-trip. Rack did fit nicely on the bumper of my car and didn't leave any scratches. If you own any sort of sedan though beware. This rack places the bike(s) above the height of the car, so not only is it difficult to lift up, but is a killer of gas mileage too. Despite being in the Saris fit guide, my Kia Rio had a drop of around 10mpg and I was travelling slow. I placed the rack on a large domestic sedan and it fit about the same, very high above the car. Apparently it is only meant for mountain bikes with wide tubes as I needed to place rags around the bike tubes on my 3 speed and hybrid in order to prevent slipping. Still the bikes did encounter a few scratches once I reached my destinations. I ended up returning the rack to Amnazon without hassle and bought the Thule Speedway which fits much lower on my car and the bikes fit on it properly.	0
"This is different from the ""Asian Saga"" books. Still, it is just as excellent. Moreover, it is short and to the point. Clavell was in a POW camp so I get the sense that it is accurate, that it lauds real people through their character portrayals (indirectly), and it scathes other people in the same way."	1
I have been using this eye gel for a few years now and while I am approaching 50, my eyes sure don't look it!	1
The chemistry between Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler was great! I never thought Drew was funny, but in this movie, she had me cracking up. The movie is basically about a woman who got into a car accident and lost her short term memory, so everyday her loved ones create the day she last remembered, which was also her father's birthday. Adam, a tourist player, comes into the picture and falls for her regardless of whether she remembers him or not. Adam is always funny and that was the reason I rented the movie. The pirate guy with the five kids had me in tears. And the Steroid Son was pretty entertaining too. This was a really funny movie that I thought was going to turn out not-so-good-but-okay-because-of-Adam. I was wrong.	1
This comes close to being the worse piece of garbage it has ever been my privilege to view. The acting...HORRENDOUS!!! CGI...poorly done. Do yourself a favor and watch the Roman version of the Odyssey...Ulysses with Kirk Douglas. It may be an oldie, but it's definitely an absolute goodie!!	0
"Some other reviewer posted that people are saying negative things or critiquing his album just due to CNN's comments. Clay is not perfect nor is his record company but it is a great album and I find myself going to back to the orginal A I tapes I have just to hear him sing out the songs like ""Everlasting Love"" and ""BOTW"" to hear that amazing range. Thats all."	1
Disappointed in this item. The tray bottom was not attached well to the sides - doesn't hold the sand. Also, the rocks are dull and all one color. Rakes seem to be OK.	0
This movie stinks. It's like watching a WCW Pay per view from that time. This film was ruined by cartoon ghosts,dumb subplots and a Disney-style good vs evil storyline. The acting is not that good. It also has too many pointless cast members & moments. The effects are laughable to the 4th power. The story is childish like See Spot Run. It's buildup is soo backwards. The worst part is when Owen Wilson gets his head cut off by that lion's head statue swinging by. I give this film a -0 out of 10.	0
This book was in very good condition and I received it in a very timely manner.	1

I wish I could give this game negative five stars! Whoever gives this game five stars is a complete loser who doesn't have any good games. This game is not really fun and it has major glitches in it. Why get this game when there are games like Super Mario World, Metroid Fusion, Advance Wars 2, or a Pokemon game! And I am not biased against Lord of the Rings games or anything like that because I enjoyed playing the Two Towers and Return of the King for the Gamecube. This game is fun for the first 15-30 minutes though. My final words are DON'T GET THIS GAME!!!!!!!	0
This is the second time I have read this book. The first was for school. I enjoyed it more this time because of the things I did appreciate the first time.	1
I am 14 years old and read Of Mice and Men for my 8th grade literature class. I usually don't like sad books, but this is DEFINITELY an exception. This is a tragic tale of friendship, love, and sacrafice, and I am crying just thinking about the end. Steinbeck tells life as it was in the '30s, never making life perfect and easy. My class and I watched the movie in class, and no one had dry eyes at the end. This book is not to be missed by anyone.	1
I somehow lost my batterie charger and was afraid I was not gonna get the same one . This is the exact same one that comes with the camera , and the shipping was fast too.	1
While Troma treated this well regarded latter day Argento film reasonably well with its DVD release, and its initial $14.98 VHS release, anyone who is a fan of this talented director's visual virtuosity and deft use of color, camerawork, and scene composition should be aware that this new, reduced-price VHS version of The Stendhal Syndrome is in the inferior *EP* speed mode. I have yet to ever see an EP release of a film on video that did not have considerable video noise and very poor color quality. Since the original, more expensive SP version of the tape appears to be in the process of being phased out by the less than artistic-oriented Troma, this is very unfortunate.Please, Troma, give us VHS buyers back a decent quality SP version of this film.And please, Amazon, do include a note in the technical information section when you do carry a VHS tape in EP mode.	0
Honsetly only read through the first few chapters. It was difficult to follow....the author jumped back and forth between timelines. If you can follow it, I'm sure there are some good facts there....but I couldn't keep up.	0

"Don't buy into the ""coolest album"" reviews, if you are into something heavy. I was referred to this group thanks to their advertised proximity to Slipknot's death-metal grind-core. I also heard ""Chop Suey"" on the TV.You can imagine my disappointment, when niether of the songs on the album, was as impressive as ""Chop Suey"", nor System of a Down's overall style corresponded with my expectations for it to be some death-metal hardcore.Basically, the songs are not that bad, but ONLY if you're into rock, or some oriental, armenian-arabic mix with horrible and meaningless lyrics and a blend of music styles. However, if you're looking for something heavy and killer, I'd say it's best to go for either Slipknot's ""IOWA"" or Slayer's ""God Hates Us All"", and leave this album to kindergarden rocker-kiddies."	0
I haven't had a chance to see the movie, I just collect things that look interesting and I have always enjoyed performances by Keanu Reeves, from the very silly excellent adventures to matrix to the evil prince in Shakespeare.	1
I have the Borner mandolin and other Borner graters which are very well designed, but this one is a total failure. The grater is almost dull, made of very thin metal that bended while sitting in the drawer. The metal blade also fell once, but I managed to insert it back. The handle is uncomfortable due to it sharp shapes. I gave the stars for the other uses, as I successfully managed to open an orange with it. It might also work for other tasks, but not for grating.I can't believe Borner was able to produce such a bad tool. I am not recommending it, as there are many other better graters on the market!	0
"I've had this product for less than a month - within a few uses, its finish started to wear off and now the wood is molding (see customer photo) ... it's a complete piece of junk. In addition to the poor quality of materials, as others have stated - it's not designed very well - handle is too short and not angled enough. Its only semi-redeemable quality was having very stiff, scratchy bristles that, for what areas of my back I could reach with it, those areas felt sufficiently scrubbed. But who wants to scrub their backs with a moldy back scrubber, no matter how stiff its bristles are? Yuck!I will return this as ""defective"" as it certainly fits that criteria in my mind - anything that can't even hold up through the 30-day return period is pretty pathetic."	0
I was surprised when I saw this movie because it was the first good Juliette Lewis I'd seen. I enjoyed the film very much. It was excellent. I thought the some of the more outre discussions between the kids were a little inappropriate, but all in all, the movie was pretty impressive. and Eliza Dushku really stole the show with her amazing debut. Worth the watch.	1

I have every single Ring Of Fire book, and in general, the series is among my favorite sci-fi works. Except for this one. This book is not only almost unrelated to the rest of the series internally, it consists of a series of incredibly inane anecdotes about raising sheep and rabbits. Certainly the dullest sci-fi book I own. The ONLY reason to read this one is because it's referenced from later works, in particular 1635 - The Dreeson Incident. You'd think that a character in a sci-fi novel should have a story at least as interesting as a normal person in real life - and this book sure misses that goal. Unless you're really, really keen on reading short children's stories about anthropomorphic rams (the sheep kind), this book is sure to disappoint.Skip this one - you'll thank me later.	0
Had a little trouble getting into the story to start but as the book progressed found myself finding it harder to put down - up to the last night when i could not go to bed without finishing first.Would look forward to other similar alternate history books by the same author	1
"Dave has outdone himself with this album. This is his third ""solo"" album on the independant label he runs in Iowa City called Trailer Records. Dave can sound like rock n roll, folk, Alt-Country, and bluesy among other unknown or unnamed styles. The Big Night explores these different musical styles and puts them together to form his unique sound. If you like Bob Dylan, Greg Brown, Todd Snider, The Rolling Stones, or any similar atists you should give this album a try."	1
"I love this CD. I listen to it at least 5 times a day. It's different form the first CD though. They have a lighter attitude, with songs like ""When I grow up"" and ""Special"" this band knows how to keep you wanting more. If you didn't like the first CD( You really sould though) you will feel different about this one."	1
20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (Books of Wonder)is one of my favourite books of all time. Verne has managed to writing an intriguing, invigorating and adventure-filled adventure that also delves into questions morality and religion. Verne's love of science and technology is a leading theme through out the book and one gets a lesson in the marine-life as it was known during his lifetime. The illustrations by the Dillon's are certainly a work of art to bestow and admire. The afterword by Peter Glassman is very well-written and informative. I can highly recommend this book to readers of all ages and I gave this amazing classic a strong 5/5. 5/5.	1
it moved me to tears and no book has ever done that, it was very deep. very scary because its pluasable	1
Exactly as advertised the famous Converse Chuck Taylor All Star Sneaker is a great buy! Looks great, fits great and is super comfortable. I highly recommend it!	1
This book was quite possibly the worst book i've ever had to read. No wait, the worst ever was The Pearl! What is wrong with Steinbeck? Why does he feel he needs to kill main characters? I would seriously recomend that you never read this book ever. If you have to for highschool, I feel extremely sorry for you. In cnclusion I just have to say George, just let Lennie tend the Frickin' rabbits and Kino, throw the pearl away already!	0

I bought this book from Amazon sight unseen because my 4 year old is now a big sister. I was very pleasantly surprised with the clever design, humor, and fun colorful illustrations drawn by 'Dilly'. It is really aimed at older children (maybe 7-11), especially the humor which is right on for that age. It is great for younger kids too if you don't mind your 4 year picking up expressions like 'gross me out' and 'punky' (which are now common expressions in our house). My daughter is an early reader and this book motivates her to read independently or at least pore over the pictures a lot. I look forward to the sequel re. Dilly's camping experiences.	1

We usually use the huggies pure and natural, huggies snug and dry, and pampers swaddlers (both older type and the newer dry max). We used another baby's diapers which were these pampers baby dry, and my son got huge rash splotches in several areas. I had heard about parents complaining about rashes and thought it was only a concern for babies with sensitive skin, but in 10 months this was the first time my son got a rash from the diaper. Glad we don't have a box of these around to throw out! I can't comment on how effective the diapers are on wetness and containment since we don't use them regularly.	0

Though this album has three great singles, it has traits that many debuts carry: lots of filler and undevelopment, but promise. This is notable in the Depeche Mode colletion, if only because it was Vince Clarke's only album with the boys. However, he would go on to create better albums with Yaz and Erasure, and the rest of Depeche Mode would move into darker territory. Besides, some of this music sounds really corny and dated.	0

It is easy in this day of age to forget about the troubling aspects that are still facing public schools in our large cities. With this book, Jean Anyon does not let us forget the problems that are still facing these schools today. This book provides a different and important perspective on public school reform in this nation. Anyon does not jump to blame the schools, teachers and students like is done so often when schools fail, but rather she portrays how cummulative effects of school and public officials decisions have tied the hands of the public education reformers in those cities. Anyon's ideas are more comprehensive, and she does not want to just change the schools, but the city itself. This book is very compelling and insightful and offers a great look inside the doors of the public school system in our urban environment.	1
Of mice and men is a brilliant book. Steinbeck is a colourful writer and shows how some men can be compassionate to the weak (in this case weak in the mind!), others passive and worse still, others can be cruel. very powerful!	1
This movie was a travesty of Hitchcockian devices. Old Alfred would roll in his grave. The acting was wooden, the dialogue cliched and predictable and not very convincing (wouldn't a Freudian analyst have recognized the flower arranging dream case study right away?) Bassinger looks like she's been on too many meds, with her bloated face and more-than-normally squinted eyes. Nor can she play a psychotic with any zest: when she lost it in the restaraunt in her husband's presence, running up the stairs and proceeding to yell and flail, I felt embarrassed for her. If I had more space I could go on, but I want to end with one burning question; Why the hell didn't the wardrobe mistress give Bassinger a decent pair of stilleto pumps to at least wear with her slinky black backless dress, if she insisted on outfitting her through the whole movie with dopey little flats?	0
"My daughter doesn't complain, so they must be fine. Also, she prefers her diapers rather than wearing panties, so they must be good. Conversation: Would you like to wear panties?

I needed a wireless pci card to get internet access from my garage, but I got more than what I expected. My computer is about 40-45 ft. away from the actual router and is in a completely separate part of the house. I'm surprised that I get 75-80 percent signal strength from where I am, which was way less that my last one that had the small antenna attached directly to the pci card. All I can say is the price and the product are both awesome.	1

I purchased this item to replace a broken hose. It took the seller over 3 weeks to ship the item, even though the tracing website always showed a different and incorrect shipping date. Upon receipt the product looked nothing like the product on the website. The handle was completely different. In addition, the hose was BLACK and not white as the picture showed. I contacted the seller to replace the item with the proper hose. After several phone calls back and forth, the seller claimed he knew which hose we needed and would ship it that day. I called back 5 days later to find out that the item hadn't even been shipped yet. We requested a refund and got our money back promptly, however it still left us without the hose we needed. So basically, over 5 weeks after ordering the item we still did not have a replacement. What made matters worse, is that we were stuck paying almost $40.00 in return charges, which were not covered by the seller. AVOID THIS SELLER!	0
this was the best deal online by far.very nice jacket couldnt ask for a better item at the price.Thank you	1
this tour was very person and as janet represented from the start of the concert, an open book of HER story of her life, music, feelings and so forth. The concert begins with a big book being opened and then seperated into two screens then comes janet. She sings songs from velvet rope which are perfectly mixed with classic dance hits of hers over the years. A lot of the control and rhythm nation songs were made into medleys though some of the ones with intense choreography like If, Rhythm Nation and so forth were performed wonderfully. Janet also created great new chorography for what about, you and i get lonely which could have also been singles. I wish Everytime was sang on this show though that ballad is just so beautiful. It was great to see rope burn and special included.	1
I gave up on this thing halfway through. I just could not watch any more. Cage runs around in a badly cut suit, his head turned at an angle as if he can't hear the director, and there is no discernible plot or purpose. We don't notice Cage's bad acting the way we did in Wicker Man, because all the rest of the actors are so bad Cage does not stand out. One good thing about the movie is, Cage plays a coke addict. The bad thing about it is, he didn't OD and give us all a break.We can give this one a pass, though.	0
I've been using Amazon for years and this is the first time I've left a comment because I hope that you won't waste your money like I did. I have 2 sons. My baby uses the Swaddlers and my toddler uses Cruisers. When Cruisers was unavailable online, I thought, the Baby Dry can't be that much different, they both are made by Pampers, right? WRONG!! I have been washing wet bed sheets and pjs every single morning for 2 weeks since my toddler used the Baby Dry. It can not hold anything. I had my son pee in a clean Baby Dry standing straight, waited for a minute, then took the diaper off. The pee was dripping out from the diaper. It was the worst diaper we have ever tried. I heard that Pampers changed the Cruisers to be thinner as well. I am giving Huggies a try now. Though it was not as soft as Pampers, I have not need to wash the wet bed sheet or pjs for the past week. Now I have a big box of Baby Dry diapers sitting in my garage that I can't decided if I should donate...	0
I'm underwhelmed by this mug warmer, but perhaps that's the best we can hope for.Pros:Switch is in the base, not four feet away in the far reaches of the middle of cord.Light tells you it's on, when not blocked by the mug.It has not yet burned house down when I forget to turn it off.It still works after I forgot to turn it off.Cons:It does not turn self off -- wasting electricity.Short cord barely reaches existing electrical source at a desk with a multi-plug power strip.Lukewarm is it.Has lasted two months.	0

I have seen all the earlier Batman movies and I must say this is by far the greatest. The older ones were ok, but lacked that realistic feel. In Batman Begins I felt moved by it, it was realistic, it was dramatic, and it felt real. This movie is a must buy for any action/adventure lover.	1

If you are interested in learning about Saudi Arabia, this is not the book for you. It is a collection of the writer's true or imagined sexual experiences. Having lived in many countries I believe there is so much to see, learn, teach, get involved in, etc.,that focusing on sex is a waste of the experience. Writing style and vocabulary is also very simple, almost childlike. I'm almost finished with the book, and so far there is only one chapter that I found interesting.	0

"While the basic instruction is passable, the technique of most of the dancers, including the instructor, is mediocre to poor. What's truly terrifying is how frail and anorexic most of these women look. There's an unfortunate sort of L.A. starved-skinny bleached-blonde airheadedness to this production. Belly dance can be a powerful, grounded and grounding ethnic dance form; however this tape presents more of a ""wrap yourself in sequins and wriggle for your husband"" sort of vibe. Culturally divorced and ugly-American scary. Made me want to shave my head and get tattoos."	0
Can someone please tell me how she managed to be signed by A!!!!record label, let alone one capable of putting her music (if that's what you call it) into the airwaves as much as it is.	0
This book simply explains the process of living and dying, by giving examples of the lifecycle of certain animals and how they eventually die. It could have had alittle more emotion, because there is always emotion connected to losing a loved one. Even children feel that emotion or loss.	1
This is one of the worst show I've ever seen. Don't waste your money buying it. Your time is better spent cleaning out gutters than watching this tripe.I would have rated this show minus stars if it were possible.	0
I bought this toy for my daughters first birthday, and she absolutely loves it. We had to buy extra balls for the ball pit, but others than that it has been awesome.	1
Excellent show. Adult Swim is being cheap with dvd packaging. ATHF, Venture Bros. Season 4.1, and Squidbillies vol. 3.1 ALL have SERIOUS lack of quality and artwork. I expect this is across the board. It's sad, I do not know what is happening here but my days of buying Adult Swim DVD seasons is over.	1
If you have any interest in American history, Nantucket whaling, or a great sea story....then you must read this book. This true story is what Moby Dick was based upon.	1
This is perfect for the twins I have we go thought the smaller amounts very quick but I buy a couple big boxes and I'm covered for a while	1
I still haven't figured out how to put this light together. When I do, the wires appear very delicate and I doubt it will even work. The directions are atrocious. But at least it doesn't require batteries, so you can feel good about not destroying the environment too much.	0
At least it has the saving grace of being short. Our two heroes wander aimlessly from adventure to adventure in a series of dull vignettes.	0
"As a Catholic I guess I could be offended by the ""third secret"",however I chose to believe that most of the church standings on most issues are man made, not God inspired. I remember as child waiting anxiously for the revelation of the ""third secret"", when it was announced by John Paul 11 I was disappointed, I expected more........and that is how the story goes.I have read all 3 of Steve Berry's books and this is by far his best. But before you get all bent out of shape this, this is just a story, a work of fiction. I really enjoyed it and lovers of historical fiction will too."	1
It has made my life a lot easier since giving up on those remote phone jacks for me tivo connections. Now I dont have to make a connection every 5-7 days or at all unless there has been a real power outage or router difficulty.what a joy	1
I absolutuly HATED this book. Only read it for school. IT is awful. STAY AWAY from this evil novel. no offence tended for the author. It was too discriptive and you have to look up half the words in the dictionary. This has 0 stars but I can only put 1.	0
This bed was purchased as a spare bed for short time visitors as we are limited in space in our Park Model RV. We needed someting that didn't take up much room to store and yet was comfortable enough so that as person could get a decent nights sleep on it. After reading all the reviews I could find, I deduced that some of these beds were faulty (like all things) and that they tended to deflate overnight, but, that most were fine. Our bed has met all of our expectations and is fine, comfortable and holds the air. I would highly recommend this product!!	1
As a long time Kurt Cobain fan ,Kurt was the reason I learned guitar years ago ,I was always a singer and songwriter since I was young but when Nirvana came out in 1991 I learned guitar as well cause the man inspired me too not just sing but write my own riffs.on this release save the money and buy the whole box set it is worth it, except for Courtney being the Yoko Ono money whore that she is and saving these extra demo tracks for this cd instead of putting every last outake demo live etc on last years boxed set.so you have to buy this cd just for the 3 new tracks.I know Courtney has enough money so I would'nt buy this cd.Kurt should not be remembered this way with his widow milking every dollar she could get.I will make sure if I become famous that only my children would be in control of my music who would treat it with respect.	0
"I love Clay Aiken to death, but I was really disappointed with this CD... I really feel that it is too commercial. I love his voice and he ""curled my toes"" when I saw American Idol. He and Ruben were my picks. I was sad when Clay didn't win, and I liked the ""Bridge Over Troubled Waters"" CD single, but I didn't like this. I won't pre-order any more... I'll wait to hear clips."	0
I purchased one of these shirts from Sport Check and paid $30 for it. It was comfortable and I had no problems with it until 1 day I noticed some white flakes on the front of it. When I tried to wipe them off I saw that it was the material that was flaking off in a perfect circle. The more I brushed the bigger the hole grew. Now you can see through the center of my shirt like some nylon stockings, which looks pretty girly. For a $30 shirt I sure expected to get a lot more wear out of it.	0
This is an interesting book which will give you a lot of insight into daily life in the 19th century. There is a lot that is outdated in terms of daily living, education and of course technology. However, there are some gems in this book. For instance, she talks about how she helped her corns on her foot by placing a cut cranberry on them. She also recommends a raw onion for a wasp sting.For anyone interested in historical views, there are sections on raising daughters, how to deal with poverty and philosophy about travel.	1
THE DVD WAS A GIFT AND I AM EMBARRASED THAT IT DOES NOT WORK. IT WAS PUT IN 3 DIFFERENT DVD PLAYERS AND NO GO. I WANT ANOTHER WANT SENT TO ME FREE WITH NO COST FOR POSTAGE AS WELL. I WANT IT SENT EXPRESS.	0
I ordered this strictly as a keyboard and mouse holder for my family room computer. I wanted to be able to game and browse comfortably from my couch. This works Perfectly. Allows my keyboard and mouse to stay securely in place even while moving. I would recommend this for anyone who is looking for a similar solution.	1
"Clay Aiken's album is an absolute joke. The songs on this album are so lame and so cliche. I mean just look the first single ""Invisible."" Usually labels put out their best song on the album first and ""Invisible"" is what they came up with? Give me a break. This song has no lasting airplay capabilities. Also, if this cd was the greatest ever, why don't they let you listen to the songs on the album on this site. The other albums that I've viewed on this site have the song available to listen to. That's because it suckssssssssssssssssssssss and they know it does. If people were able to listen beforehand, they wouldn't buy this horrible cd. One more thing what kind of title is ""Measure of Man."" Barf!!!! Save your money people, please!!! The one star is for pitty, I guess."	0
"While I like ""Fort Apache,"" I feel that there is too much horseplay in the movie as well as too much Shirley Temple-John Agar. Joanne Dru is far superior in a similar type of role in the follow-up ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon."" The screenplay to ""Fort Apache"" could have been tightened up dropping about 10 minutes and giving it a more streamlined result. ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon"" is a superior film because of a better handled script. Having said that, ""Fort Apache"" is still very entertaining. Its strength is in its opposing characters played by Henry Fonda and John Wayne. It's easy to focus on Fonda's martinet of a commander, but Wayne is excellent in his somewhat secondary role. He's almost an observer on equal footing with the supporting players and that generosity pays off with a very likeable, heroic character. I don't like ""Fort Apache"" enough to add it to my collection, as I have ""She Wore a Yellow Ribbon,"" but it's still a film to watch and enjoy."	1
While this is not exactly the great movie it's reputation suggests, it comes close. It is a must-see for Brando fans, in particular. It is hard to seperate his performance from the movie itself - he is the movie; the director intended it to be that way. Almost all the details of Brando's character were modeled after him, which makes it all the more facinating. Gato Barbieri's music is also great, making the movie even more effective.	1
"Well, I am among those who expected the basic performances along with the documentary, based on the packaging and the song titles listed in the text.I'm glad so many people like it because that means I will have no trouble selling my copy.The sound quality didn't impress me, and the ""specially recorded"" versions of some songs told me only that the members have lost their voices. (offstage: ""Sacrilege! Burn him!"")Even the navigation was annoying - click,click, click, click to get to any one song.Bah!"	0
"This works really well. I used it to help get my abdominal wall back together at 9 months post-partum. It's still a bit separated but this definitely helped. I wish I knew about it sooner. It also helps support the back when picking up my child over and over and over again and a good reminder to keep my weak abs pulled in when doing it. Great to wear during exercise, again as a reminder to keep the abs in and strengthen them correctly inward. Also, it looks hot! And sometimes I wear it out. I wear it with a tank top underneath as suggested in other reviews all the time. Suggest getting seamless tanktops otherwise irritation may occur. 27"" waist before pregnancy, 30"" waist when I bought a size medium, 28"" now, and could probably get the next size down if I really wanted..."	1
I've had this case for close to a year now and had no problems with it up until 2 months ago when I noticed one of the plastic hinges that attaches the Palm to the case snapped off, the remaining intact hinge has held up for about 2 months so far. The clasp has been fine and holds the case firmly shut, great access to all buttons and slots. I would have given it 5 stars but the hinge broke.	1
You'd be hard-pressed to tell a boring story about about a plucky country newspaper editor who had principles and stuck to 'em. But this author has done it. He says the book is an adaptation of his doctoral thesis. That fits. The book reads like a well-done, fully footnoted college paper, not like a dramatic novel. It strives to identify key historical facts at the expense of the reader's interest. With a modest amount of effort, it could have been reworked as a compelling autobiographical novel bolstered by its remarkable display of features of midwestern life during the first half of the 20th Century.	0
Some people call it cheap and flimsy. But I call it thin and delicate. and that's how it should be when you're opening a wine bottle. It is extremely easy to pop out the cork with this corkscrew. It also works with synthetic corks. No extra strength required at all. Believe me you'll be amazed after using this product. It comes with a nice container, which is a bonus.	1
I was anxiously awaiting Clay's CD and bought it in pre-sale. After hearing it for the first time, I bought several more copies for loved ones! Clay is amazing and the CD is absolutely wonderful! Devoted Clay fans will be extremely proud, and others will be impressed by the range of this album. I saw a review that stated it was wonderful vanilla -- but I say it's full of rich flavors. I can honestly say that every song is good, and most are ideal showcases for Clay's amazing vocal instrument. I will surely wear out both CDs I'm keeping for my own use! Thank you, Clay and RCA, for this wonderful CD!	1
this book should be worshiped as the bilble so that I dont have to go to church. the reason this book was so funny is becouse jokes are funnier writen down.	1
We were dissapointed to discover that the DVD that we got was the same format and picture quality as the original VHS. I believe there is a restored version, we streamed a good quality full screen version from Netflix and I will be looking for this on DVD.	0
Mesmerizing, Haunting, & Touching are words to describe this movie. The characters, well acted and their stories get under one's skin. A must see.	1
I earlier wrote that I did not receive these as ordered, but the seller immediately contacted me and sent this item quickly. Great service! The look is fun and sexy -- these are cut REALLY low. They will probably reveal a bit of butt cleavage, but my girlfriend and I really like the different look and feel of these quality panties. I knocked off one star because they run a bit small; order a size up if in doubt.	1
"It is curious that one one the more significant achievements of ""Pastor"" Charles Taze Russell is omitted above. That fact is that he was the primary founder of the Watchtower Bible and Tract Society, and the religion now known as ""Jehovah's Witnesses."" No small amount of his theology is controversial in the body of the Church as a whole, as it would be (for different reasons, perhaps) amongst Jehovah's Witnesses."	0
"I bought this to prep myself and my husband for the natural (midwife attended) birth of our second child. It is a reasonable video and keeps you fairly entertained. However I do not agree with everything that is ""taught"" on this video; I guess that's why we chose a midwife instead of a doctor/hosptal for this birth. If you buy this video (or get it from the local library) make sure you take what is said with a grain of salt. Birthing on your back in a hospital is NOT the best or least traumatic way to bring a new baby into the world! Good luck!!"	1
The GKI/ Bethlehem Ligh Glacier Christmas Tree is the first artificial tree that looks real and fools most of my guests. We saw the same tree at a well known hardware store for double the price. The tree is easy to assemble and even comes with a DVD that explains how to put tree together. The tree comes adorned with pinecones and snow frosted tips. It looks just like the trees we cut near Placerville, CA. It is our first artificial tree and we love it!	1
I've been doing this (2) times a week, along with swimming a 1/2 mile at the public pool for the past 3 weeks and feel so good. This video really works your body in all the ways you need for strength and flexibility in surfing. I can't wait to get back in the ocean soon, when it gets a little warmer ! And take the power and flow of this yoga, to help me improve my surfing. Instead of working so hard to catch a wave and paddle out, at my age of 57:)	1
I have this game and have beaten but boy it was hard. It took me like a month to beat it. What I love about it is it's on the Gamecube, their are little movie clips, the action and the adventure you take. I don't like that they took choosing classes away and the plot is later on in the story. BUY THIS GAME NOW!	1
If life could be that way, we were all having a few chances to make things right.	1
"I bought this book in the 5th grade and was absolutely mesmerized by it. Over the past 15 years I have read it over and over again and have appreciated it on a different level each time as I, too, have grown-up with the lead character of ""Francie"". If you have ever wanted to travel in time with your best childhood friend, this novel is one way to experience bustling Brooklyn, New York from the turn of the century through the first World War. I cannot recommend it enough and the movie truly does not do it any justice. A must-read for all ages!"	1
I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!	1
The book is very easy to read and understand, gives very clear explanations, but it could it be great if it included a practice CD like most ASVAB books now come with...	1
It's easy, there're only a few possibilities why you like this album:1. You're a little gal in your early teens, and u think he's, well, cute.2. You know zilch about music. You're trying to be a victim of the mushrooming commercial music that I'm so sick of.Did u ever feel a rush of blood oozing to your heart. NO? Then his songs probably dun impress you much.	0
If you're politically inclined, you'll love this novel about Oceania. Though this book is fiction, you'll find more similarities with your life than you thought possible. The symbolism is great and should be a must-read for any high school student in a high school civics course.	1
I have kept trac of Clay since AI. I Cannot get enough of his new wave of music. He has a very unique voice and is very talented and pure. His voice shines and his personality only makes him more interesting. A bold approach by him to capture an audiance that is tired of the garbage that is being put out there by so called singers of now. He is showing that there is a huge market for a less blatent sexual market of music needed for a huge demogragraphic. But at the same time he captures the , can I say Hotness, that is there without being crude . I can see him going very far with a very needed new/old concept . Can I compare him with Frank Sinotra with a twist of new wave. He sings with a flair that from young to old, each drawing there own conclusions from his lyrics and making them their own feelings and meanings of each song as they perceive them.	1
The june 2011 shipment of the pampers cruisers diapers was way below par. The diapers were too thin and leaking all the time.I'm on auto-shipment	0
This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!	0
This is a very good description of Luftwaffe Operations on the Eastern Front. It has good background information speciffically about the economic side of it. Decisions made based on oil supply's rather than military objectives. Very interesting material.The only bad thing about this book is that the editing comes across as very sloppy. German names are often misspelled or incorrect. It is not Manstein, but von Manstein, not Bock, but von Bock, not Kluge, but von Kluge.Also it is not Count von Sponneck but Graf von Sponneck. If you overlook those issues, it is a very good book	1
This is a movie that does a great job of using CGI to create some awesome scenes. Despite the formula plot and silly side-show drama, the flying scenes make this movie worth watching over and over.	1
"This is one of those ""it's about time"" DVD releases. The first season of ""Three's Company"" was a short one, given only six episodes. But it was wonderful to see them in their original colorful, vibrant presentations. The show stands the test of time and this is a must-own DVD for any classic TV fan.The only fault, naturally, is the lack of features and the small number of episodes. It might have worked better if they had combined this with season two and released a loaded collection next year. As it stands, season two will be released next year and I fully expect a five-star collection."	1
I bought this pillow after finding out a hotel I stayed in used the same. I don't if it was the product I received but it wasn't as comfortable as I remembered in the hotel and after few washes, the comfort level started to plunge as the feathers started to poke. I won't spend my money on this ever again!	0
"'Till We Have Faces' is not the retelling of Cupid and Psyche, it is the story of the troubled sister watching from a distance. Reading this story was like looking from the outside in; the view of a non-Christian of the beautiful, but mysterious joy of the Christian. It is a breathtaking story told in a style completely unlike Lewis, bringing together the light and dark of a legend of ancient Greece, with a deeper understanding of human nature.""For now we see through a glass, darkly; but then face to face: now I know in part; but then shall I know even as also I am known."" ~1 Corinthians 13:12"	1
"This book was recommended to me by a co-worker. I often love to read the recommendations of others, but after this experience I will be more cautious! This book was quite simply one of the more boring books I've ever read. Its simple-minded prose irritated me to the point of distraction. I was grateful for the distraction though, because the prose itself was mind numbing. The chapters could just as well have been titled: ""Jim almost meets Ty Cobb!"" ""Jim Climbs A Tree!"" ""Jim Gets A Baseball Bat!"" and the titles would sum up every piece of action contained. The characters were lifeless and virtually indistinguishable from each other."	0
I have only had them a week and already they are falling apart, I would not recommend them to anyone	0
"In my opinion, the sound quality is quite good. However, as other reviewers have pointed out, these headphones are not durable. I have been treating mine with plenty of care, but today, 6 months after my purchase, they simply fell apart. The headband broke in two places: on both sides, one just below where it says ""R"", and the other side just above where it says ""L""."	0
I ordered Alter Ego for men but got Alter Ego for woman. I followed the procedure given on the the web to complain and ask how to do the return, but did not get any answer.	0
"Smallville season 9 is downright the worst season of Smallville. The plot is not interesting at all. The plot of Smallville has really gone downhill. However, the finale episode showed great promise. I believe that where smallville really got messed up, was when Micheal Rosenbaum (Lex Luthor) wanted to leave the show. In my opinion ""Lex Luthor"" was a big reason why the first 5-7 seasons of Smallville where so good. I think if the producers could convince Rosenbaum to come back, that would turn the show around.Overall, I thought season 9 of Smallville just was not very good, however, I have hopes that the 10th (and final) season will be great!"	0
"An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."	0
When I order a book I expect a Book 6x9 inches, what I received was an shrunken facimily 4x7 trying very hard to make it to the major leagues. I would send it back but it would cost more than the imitation is worth.	0
I was really disappointed in this item. When it said Bling Bling, I expected something that had rhinestones and glamour. I got it and saw only silverlike painting on it. Not glamourous for my 2 girls. I sent it back.	0
This diaper is OK during the day. It is very thin, flimsy, feels really cheap, but it is sufficient to hold a medium-size mess during the day. However, it leaked all over every single night no matter what we tried. I would actually test different diapers every night, and this one would always have the most leaks all over. Cruisers did a bit better, Huggies did as well (actually as bad) as Cruisers...but, still there were leaks every night! If you are used to Swaddlers, be ready for a huge disappointment! This diaper cannot be used overnight. Our boy is 13 months and 24 lbs,and is long. Even tried a size bigger as it was suggested. Had to go back to Swaddlers...size 4 (sensitive-the only type of Swaddlers in 4) and no more leaks! There are never any leaks with Swaddlers!!! Pampers Baby Dry is the worst Pampers diaper I have ever used!!	0
********* W A R N I N G ! ************* STAY AWAY FROM THIS ONE! ****This movie is pretty bad! Ultra low budget movie with terrible acting and a boring plot, which combined with a huge stuggle to stay and watch should have given this one a NEGATIVE FIVE STAR RATING!!!MONEY DOWN THE TUBES WITH THIS ONE!!!	0
For years and years, I always had to watch A Charlie Brown Christmas on broadcast television. I could never miss it! I finally missed it this year, and had to buy the DVD. Now, I will still watch it, even in the dead of summer. Even though there's nothing extra on the DVD, it's still fun to have it around for whenever you feel like watching it! A must have for kids and adults, alike!	1
Like other reviewers, I'm baffled as to why this is not in letterbox. I can live without super-duper extras, but I have no reason to upgrade from my VHS until a widescreen version is published. The rating is reflective of my dislike of the fullscreen formatting. The movie itself is one of the great romantic comedies-a love letter to love itself, and NYC.	0
"""Be Here Now"" is for sure the best Oasis album. It has their greatest songs, and it shows how well they can make music.When I bought this CD I wasn't sure if I was going to like, but after I listened to songs like ""D'You Know What I Mean?"", ""All Around The World"", ""Stand By Me"", and the title track ""Be Here Now"", I saw that once again Oasis did a great job!!"	1
Finally an official R1 release of Initial D Stage IV...and its really good! Visual presentation is not bad at all, the best of all Inital D stages in fact. And the Japanese audio track is done really well - best sound quality I have ever heard from Initial D. The subtitles are passable, not that bad. The English dub is still horrible...but then again there has NEVER been a good Dub of any Initial D stages. The video is present in 4:3 widescreen format, not 16:9 as indicated on the DVD cover. Initial D has never been made in 16:9 ratio anyways, has always been 4:3 format.Stage 4 is the best quality of all the Stages, both in art and story.Highly recommended.	1
"I read this book for AP English and had to do a blue-book assignment of it. The word ""ugh"" summarizes my experience.This book was written in the 19th century, and that's where it belongs. It wouldn't be nearly as bad if someone were to modernize the language used in the book, but reading through ""dost thou"" after ""dost thou"" isn't any fun.However, I highly recommend reading Richard Armour's take on SL in his book ""The Classics Reclassified""."	0
this is a good chart with good design. but one major problem....the chart is printed on three boards. however, with the fabrics in between the boards, the measurements end up being off!!! so your child will be measured a fraciton of an inch short! i am going to try to return it. if not, then i will need to tape the boards CLOSER together.	0
...especially if you know someone who was in WWII. I bought a copy for my father - a retired AF Colonel, who was in WWII. We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Tom Brokaw at the VFW in South Dakota in Nov. 1998 as he toured the country looking for vets whose stories he could share on his television special in Jan. 1999. If you could have seen the look in my father's eyes as he relived some of his best and worst memories. If only I could have had an autographed copy of the book. I will settle for a picture of my father and me as we talked with Tom about his days growing up in So Dakota and his love for the brave soldiers that worked so hard to maintain the freedoms for all of us. God Bless you all.....all of you who have ever been to battle. Only you can know it's horror. Our thanks is all we have to offer.	1
If you are interested in Renaissance Italy, gender studies, or the history of the Christian Church, this book is for you. This book presents the story of an ambitious abbess on the road to sainthood a la Catherine of Siena and her fall from grace as she becomes too powerful for the comfort of her male collegues. It is the story of the making and unmaking of a saint. This is one of my favorite books of all time.	1
This product did not work for me. Even though the active ingredients are the same as name brands, the formulation seems to be different. For the price, you might want to try a bottle to see if it will work for you.	0
I began reading Steve Berry's books in order. The first two were fine. The Third Secret was just absurd. I got almost to the end and just gave up. Very rarely will I not finish a book once I get into it. I can overlook some implausability and use my imagination when reading, but this was just too far. I thought Dan Brown's Demons & Angels was pretty farfetched at the end, but The Third Secret is even worse. I am not particularly religious, so it wasn't that I was offended by the book. I stopped reading Mr. Berry's books for quite some time after this book. I finally decided to pick up with his next book, which is much better so far.I recommend this author, in general, for some light, entertaining reading, but skip this installment.	0
Apart from the crappy instructions and lack of supplied USB cable, this is fantastic printer. VERY quiet and efficient. Some have mentioned the paper curl problem. I found that using proper laser paper greatly reduces curl. And some brands (Domtar, for example) are better than others so experiment. Improved text as well.	1
I am a huge fan of science fiction and fantasy, and have been reading these books for 20 years. I picked up the Foundation books because Asimov was supposed to be so great, and I really enjoyed his short stories. This book - all of the books in this series - is so amazingly boring it could be used to replace Thorazine. The concept was solid, but the characters made me not care at all. I kept hoping they would die simply so there would be something interesting happening. If you must read it, check it out from the library and save your money. Unless of course you're a chronic insomniac; then, by all means, buy this book.	0
"I love this series and would have enjoyed this one much more if it wasn't so full of typing errors, I don""t see anyone else complaining about this so maybe it's just my kindle. Did anyone else have a problem with this?"	0
"As a Lord of the Rings fan i was excited about the upcoming Game be Vivendi Universal. You can play as any part of the company of the ring, from the first book, "" Fellowship of the Ring"". The game follows the book very well, but the gameplay is a different story. In many areas you get stuck and find that the only way to get out of being stuck is by restarting the game. If you are willing to play, and play to finish the game, then you might find this a good game. The graphic are alright compared to others and you may find that it seems to have a dark tint. If you are a fan of the book you will enjoy this game, if not, i sugjest finding a different game to play"	0
This product has worked for me in the past but not this time. Not only could I smell this when plugged in, it smelled like burning plastic and made me physically ill.I used the collar with much better results, to be honest.	0
I love this card. It is a great value and supported DirectX 8.0 very well. It is a good value at only $.. compared to at least $... for a GeForce 4. The DDR memory really makes a difference over the SD in the GeForce. I replaced a GeForce 2 32mb with this card and did not have any problems installing it. My Pentium 4 with 394mb RDRAM and this card run Operation Flashpoint and Battlefield 1942 really well. A+	1
I think it's unfair to the movie that it is getting such bad reviews. Everyone went to the movie thinking that since this is Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler it was somehow going to be like the Wedding Singer. Well it isn't. if that's why you're reading this review stop, because it's not the Wedding Singer. The plot is completely different. If there was one movie I could only compare this movie to would be Groundhog's Day with Bill Murray, and that's only because some things are having to repeat. It's still a halarious movie with a pretty interesting plot line. The location is absolutely gorgeous. It's overall a pretty good movie that you have to see for yourself, and NOT base it off what others say.	1
"Altho I have no memory of watching ""Amahl"" on TV as a young child, I think I must have - the music is sweetly nostalgic for me. This DVD version is lovely. Touching, poignant, and well-sung. I have no problem whatsoever with the visuals and audio - they're what I grew up with!"	1
"As sad and tragic as ""Jean de Florette"" (which should be seen first) was, this is a delight, and one of Claude Berri's very best films. Emmanuelle Beart, looking like a wood nymph, is beautiful as Jean's daughter, bent on revenge, and Daniel Auteuil as the lovesick man who's past comes back to haunt him is terrific.Yves Montand is magnificent. This is one of his greatest performances, and shouldn't be missed. His scene with the blind woman is so memorable. I think about that scene often, and of how easy it is to make life changing mistakes by misunderstanding circumstances.The soundtrack by Jean-Claude Petit is lovely, using a theme from Verdi's ""La Forza del Destino"" as its main melody, and the cinematography superb. Best of all, the ending is perfection. Satisfying. A work of art completed."	1
Rec'd co2 alarm 2 weeks ago. It seems to be working fine. Feel much better having this new alarm installed as our last one was no longer functioning.	1
Really a life saver when it comes to go to a nice party and try to look spectacular especially for me that i give birth 7 months ago and i'm still try to work out the few pounds and belly i have left from that :) really i recomended. Money well spend it	1
It is a wonderful story of a girl who is very layed back and careless. My class read it together and I coldn't put it down. This is the only book where we would ask for homework to read the next chapter. I think everyone in my class loved the book. I felt like I was there through the whole book. I could picture the courthouse where Kit was pleading for her freedom. I was very scared when the large town group came to Hannah's home to burn it down. I was a great book and if you are thinkiing about buying it I think you should.	1
I am a long-time Pampers buyer and have never had a complaint before, but my latest batch of baby dry must be either defective or a new design. The tabs tear off of the diaper with the tiniest amount of force. Which means as I'm diapering my wiggly baby, I sometimes go through three diapers before I get one on that stays intact. Very frustrating for such an expensive product. Never had this experience with this brand with my older children, so have to assume Pampers is cutting corners.	0
Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone.	1
A little frustrated with the seller on this one. I bought the book and realized I got the wrong one, okay, my fault, but then I tried to contact them to return it and they just ever so not subtly refused to contact me back. Tried a couple times. This book is not good at all. I have the first one, which is amazing, but this one is so not aesthetically appealing to me. The cover made me think it would be a bunch of artists like the first but in this one they are more computer based artist and artists who paint far more loosely. Maybe that would appeal to some, or a lot, I don't know, but for me my work is tighter and this book doesn't inspire me like the first one. Overall, though, seller sucks!	0
This is a great shoo rack. It organizes my cluttered shoes and with its revolving functionality, I can easily find my shoes whenever I need them.	1
This book reads more like short stories of the authors experiences, mixed in with stories of other peoples experiences. Each chapter is presented at the most beginner level, which is nice, but repeats very simple ideas, then flies off into 10 pages of a related story. If you are looking to simply just take the cap off the bottle of psychic development this is the book. If you want to read about the author plus Jane, Dick and Joes success then this is most def. the book.	0
"Any Hawthorne work, including this one, shows why the author remains one of the most celebrated in American literature. As to subject matter, kids are more receptive to the likes of ""The House of the Seven Gables."" Perhaps adults would be too if they hadn't been forcefed ""The Scarlet Letter,"" complete with the Customs House filler, in high school. Lest the reader find this teacher cynical, note the five stars. (I also have a dog named Hawthorne and had another named Prynne.)"	1
I was looking forward to using my canon powershot again as I'd misplaced my original charger while traveling. I take the charger out of the bag, not box, and plug it in only to find that it does not work - it's not charging at all. No light, no power when I put the battery back in my camera. Will ship it back very soon for a replacement or refund!	0
I bought this Intex bed for my son. He is renting an apartment while waiting for a room assignment in a dorm.The bed, although still inflates, now has a bulge in the middle, so he falls off the bed. Even though we tried deflating and inflating the same, the problem is still there.	0
I purchased this shirt as a gift for my Dad. It was exactly what he was looking for. It is lightweight, rich-colored, good quality stitching, breathable fabric; perfect gear for a runner. This is a great gift or purchase for yourself; a definite must buy.	1
I love my nature guide to Florida birds. We have identified many birds using this invaluable tool. You can too!	1
I love this album, it has to be one of my favorite albums in my collection. Any time i hear toxicity or Chop Suey on the radio its stuck in my head all day. Any of the songs for that matter. If you love their first album you will love this one for sure. Be sure to check out Steal this album out too.	1
It took me quite sometime to actually read 'Clan of the Cave Bear', and when I did, I could finally see why it was so popular, but there was much more...Valley of the Horses followed, and there was no turning back, I read all three in one weekend. And then Plans of Passage hit the book stores, and, well like so many can't wait for the fifth, and here's counting on a sixth. I thank Jean for such an impressive story. Thanks again:)	1
Even Bela Lugosi couldn't save this turkey. The plot is idiotic, the supporting cast is dreadful, and the film is incredibly boring. Definitely not a classic.	0
After mentioning this book several times, and keeping us waiting, that she would fictionalize the whole theme and characters... came as a surprise. But then when you see how her fictional series, Canopus in Argos, developed in a science fiction setting, you tend to understand that her best work , sometimes needs to come from a distance. That being said, this novel is a fulfillment of many loose threads, and themes that she, and we all, struggle and deal with in our own ways. Throughout her body of work, a life's work, she continues to keep her eyes open and focused on both the future, AND the past.	1
"After all the hype, and comparison to Camus' ""The Stranger"", I suppose my expectations were high for this book. I found ""Autobiography of my Mother"" completely benign. In some parts, pointless. Unlike Camus' protagonist in ""The Stranger"", Xuela's world-view is too fully revealed to be cleverly wrought and too self-perpetuating to cause empathy with the reader. A self-pitying character, Xuela is hard to empathize with because she decries her father and the white ""conquerers"" for exploiting people and destroying the aboriginal population's culture; yet, Xuela also takes advantage of many -- emotionally and psychologically. Therefore, Xuela just comes across as bitter and codependent and the reader is not compelled to sympathize with her situation. I also found nothing sensual about the book -- the author's placement of masturbation description seemed to come out of nowhere and appears simply awkward. Overally, the book does not deliver compared to the hype"	0
This charger is just what I needed to replace my Apple charger and it costs a whole lot less. The only recommendation is that you make sure to plug it into a surge protector as there is no third-prong ground on it.	1
Find another version for ebookery, or go hard copy on this one. The table of contents, like the print version, organizes Poe's work into general categories, but stops there. Absent is a listing of the stories themselves, which is available in the print version. Navigating to a particular story requires you to do a search. Penguin charges a premium for a poor publishing job here.	0
The story itself was interesting, but the book is not well written. The author pads out half her sentences with adjectives and adverbs that are meant to add feeling that she apparently doesn't believe the facts will convey. She also seems unaware of the many cliches she uses. A potentially compelling story, written in an irritating, amateurish style.	0
I had seen the movie based on this book years ago. The book has as much meaning in this day and age as it did when it was written.I was captivated by how stark, dirty, dingy, and hopeless the main charcter's view of the world is, even when trying to rebell.I think it's a very insightful look into just where a society can go. Even one with the best of intentions. It's very applicable in this era.	1
Bought this rack on Monday and it got here on Tuesday. Took about 30-45 minutes to put it all together. Once I figured out that I had to take some parts apart to put them back together on the rack base, it all went well. I love how the bikes mount and feel that the bikes are more secure than on the type of racks that the bikes hang from the top tube. I would defiantly recommend this bike rack.	1
This is a concise version of the book but not the original book. Even i can't return it since there is no return policy. Accidentally i placed 2 books but i didn't find any option to cancel it. Even i tried contacting the sellers but no use.	0
It was a great deal and easy to order using Amazon. The seller was fast, the package was secured, and more important, I was happy when I got it. Once it arrived, I took it out of the package and popped it in the DVD player. When I heard the opening theme, I was in sci-fi heaven. I love Stargate SG1 and was sad to see it go. I am now starting my collection of the series since there are a lot of episodes I've never gotten to see. For me, I like watching the behind the scenes portion. I write screenplays myself and so I learn a lot from the director's and actor's point of view. If you're not into that stuff, it's still a kick to watch! I can even deal with the historical babble that Daniel rattles off. Enjoy the ride!	1
It was nice to here Enge's new cd and worth the wait. Anybody who has ever seen him perform will really think wow and close there eyes and think he is singing to me and only me. When he sings If Tomorrow Never Comes let that be a lesson on how short life really is and make sure you tell your loved ones what they mean to you.On his song Nothing a little love won't cure you can just see him up there moving that body to the song. Buy it and don't look back and say darn i should have gotten it.Enjoy i give it 1000 stars.	1
I don't know what it is about this movie, but it's horrible. That's a particularly sad thing to say after Heroic Trio is one of the best Hong Kong movies in a long time. I'm not sure if I'm annoyed with Michelle Yoeh's prolonged death or her prolonged presence with nothing to do for the rest of the movie, or the fact that the husband is killed 20 minutes into the movie.It's not just that this is one of the dumber Hong Kong movies I've seen, it's also that it had a potential to be really great. It has great stars, it's a sequel to an amazing movie and it just falls flat. Too many places where nothing's happening, dumb jokes, awful musical montages and the fight scenes don't excite me.Nothing really to recommend in this movie. I suppose if you are a diehard fan of Anita Mui, Michelle Yoeh or Maggie Cheung (whose better in Green Snake) watch it, but be prepared to be disappointed.	0
Face it - Guys like tooth picks better than floss - if we will use floss at all. If you are not into flossing try these picks. They work very well at getting between teeth and removing food that floss will miss. The tooth pick tip is tapered and ridged to get between teeth and clean out the tartar as well as food particles. The 'feathered' end is great at removing the smaller particles (similar to floss). These will improve your dental health when used regularly, and they are way easier to use than floss.	1
When my baby did #2 they always leaked. I switched to pampers swaddlers and they are perfect. I ordered these by mistake to begin with.	0
"After waiting for months to get this album I was a little disappointed with the opening track ""Invisible"". It didn't sound like the Clay we have all come to know and love. The first few tracks sounded a bit ""over-produced"" and lacked the style that makes Clay special, but as the album progresses, so do the quality of the recordings. After a few listens to the album, I've found that every song has something special to offer whether it be Clay's vocals or the lyrics or the music itself. One thing I enjoy most about the album is that it has more of a ""rock"" type feel to it on many of the tracks and doesn't fall strictly into the ""pop"" genre as most people come to know it (eg. Justin Timberlake, Justin Guarini, etc)."	1
This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948).	1
I would like to know if the balls can be purchased seperatly? I need to replace some of the balls that have been lost,destroyed,tossed away, or whatever. In a past review there was a recomdation to purchase extra balls, I would like to replace some, can you help me?	1
When I read something I like the whole story with some facts to back them up, but what I got out of this book was a guy with one side of politics while giving his opinion. Although many of his policies I tend to agree with, I just have a really hard time reading something when the entire book (well, I only got around a third way through it) is swung in one way direction. If you like reading about someone's opinion then you'll love this book, but if you're like me and just like cold hard facts leaving it up to yourself at making your own opinion, then don't buy this book.	0
"I tried to download ""Forever"" by Little Steven & the Disciples of Soul, and through a very deceptive listing accidentally downloaded this very substandard cover version. It's not the .99 cents that was stolen from me that I am worried about. It's a local bar band cheating people by listing the original artist as the performer when they know perfectly well they've never been in a studio with Little Steven."	0
Steinbeck writes the beautifull yet sad tale of two men trying to find a place for themselves durring the Great Depression. I first read this book at the age of 13. I read it in one sitting (not hard to do as it is only around 110 pages) and then cried and cried. An excellent book for young adults as well as adults. It will move you.	1
When we got this product it worked great. After a year though, the pressure is next to non-existent and I cannot find a troubleshoot guide to find out what the problem is, or how to fix it. I consider myself very handy and can usually figure these things out, but this one has me stumped. It acts like there is air getting into the system and the result has been damage to the motor or something.The company is absolutely no help at all in advice for fixing this machine.Sorry, but I cannot recommend it as highly as those who are doing so.	0
Does exactly what it is supposed to do. Keeps warm beverages warm. No, it will not heat a cold cup of coffee nor will it keep your beverage at scalding temperatures. But if you put your mug on it will your drink is still at least lukewarm, this doo-dad will keep it warm enough so that it's still pleasant to drink. To give you an idea of how hot this thing gets, the plate is warm enough that it *could* burn you if you left your hand on it, but will not burn with a quick touch.	1
can not believe I watched the whole movie, I kept hoping it could get better. Never did get any better, only worse	0
I recommend this product and i had no problem with the company that it came from. It got here on time and in Great shape.	1
The book was written by progressives as an attempt to rewrite history about the Christian heritage of the Americans who signed the Declaration of Independence and Constitution. This is not a scholarly work. It has no footnotes for reference. It was debunked by scholars the next year after it was written. It is an interesting reading to understand the effort that the authors and the people they represent would go to to advance their political agenda. It is a very unfactual book that distorts truth. With this understanding, people should read scholarly books to understand the Christian legacy of these people.	0
I see why clay was'nt nominated for a grammy, this cd is not grammy material, this cd is strickly for those who have bad taste in music, all though I think clay has a desent voice he need to get better writers for his music...but I guess all that matters is his fan's are happy, however Kelly, Ruben and now Fantasia there the real product, getting a million dollar contract is the icing on the cake, that's how you can tell the winner's from the losers.	0
"Let me clarify something: I give this recording four stars only because I prefer his late-period playing (post-1965) to his modal playing simply because he became freer with his employment of scalar and atonal techniques. Having said that, ""A Love Supreme"" is an astonishing album and one that all serious listeners should own. It stands out from Coltrane's earlier modal works by its devotion to the spiritual aspect of music, an element that also dominated his work in free jazz. Trane plays beautifully and very distinctively throughout, his keening sound alternately gliding over and colliding with his remarkable rhythm section. If you're considering buying this album, stop considering it. You'd be crazy not to."	1
Historically based detective story about Richard III's England which is being investigated by a modern day Scotland Yard officer named Grant. The story bounces back and forth between the Grant's `investigation' and visits to the hospital in which Grant is a patient. This is a short story that introduces into the reader to a historical event without making it the overly boring book non-historians are expecting.	1
"Two of Frankie Laine's great albums with Johnny Williams are reissued on one disc- to excellent effect! Although the arrangements and style of these 60s albums resemble Laine's and William's work on ""Hell Bent for Leather,"" in this case the songs are not cowboy songs, but, in the case of ""Dueces Wild,"" gambling songs, and, in the case of ""The Call of the Wild,"" klondike-adventure songs. No popular singer has ever explored this rough and ready terrain with Frankie Laine's success, and it's a thrill to hear him charge through such masculine songs as ""Call of the Wild"" and ""Roving Gambler."" Even songs that had proved major hits for other artists are remade in Laine's image: Johnny Horton's ""North to Alaska"" comes to mind. Some may find these selections and arrangements trite and old-fashioned- and they are- but the sheer strength and passion exhibited here is hard to dislike."	1
Great Movie! Really makes you think. It is based on the theory that every second of every day determins your ultimate fate and even if one second was different, it could change your whole life. There are twists and turns in this movie as Lola races to protect the destiny of her lover. Run Lola Run!	1
I was assassinged this book as a project in the 6th grade. I hardly liked it because it was alittle to old of print and of terms other so don't read this book if u like to be happy	0
We are to the end of our experience with diapers as little one is potty training but this SERIOUSLY is the most amazing value and I wish I had found it sooner! 172 size 5 diapers delivered for $30.00? Plus an additional month of free 2 day shipping? This is a no brainer!	1
I purchased aiw 7500 aprox. 1yr. ago. I thought it was a decent card when I bought it at that point would have given it a 4star rating. Within three months the card started freezing my machine while using DVR. Then more reciently the video with the tuner started flashing bright than dark. It happens all the time making the tuner unusable. I have found no resolution to my problems from ati. I'm not angry just unsatisfied.	0
I waited a while before I reviewed so that I could give a GOOD review and this works amazing, trust me you need to get used to it but you WILL and please buy according to size chart it does stretch after sometime but you need to SUCK IT IN when you first put it in my lower belly pudge is almost gone!	1
We don't know what they were thinking when they chose this book as required reading but it was bad with a capital B. We love reading but give us a break. Lord of the flies must have been written by another author. We do not recommend this book unless you need help falling asleep.	0
Who told Antonio Banderas he could sing? He can't. Madonna can but could only sing this score, one of Andrew Lloyd Webber's good ones (and they are becoming rare items), if Hollywood had it lowered for her. This does spoil the balance of the musical, but Hollywood doesn't care about things like that. They also gave her a song belonging to another character which makes no dramatic sense whatsoever. Hollywood doesn't care about things like that, either.There are many recordings of the stage musical available. Buy one of those instead.	0
This is a great game!! There are lots of new units like dragons and the story line is prety good. It has the weapon triangle like the rest of them, but the magic triangle changed which stinks. But, still in this one, you can give your units extra experience, you get to forge your own weapons, and you can change the color which is cool. The graphics are a bit better. But, still the same types of batte maps. Overall, this game is awesome!!!	1
"I'm a mother of 4 children under the age of four, 3 of whom are in diapers. I talk to a lot of moms, and for some, Huggies is the brand of choice, but for my kids, I always have relied on Pampers. Every time my kids wear another brand, those diapers prove to be unreliable (and somewhat disasterous). Pampers have always worked on my skinny-bummed children, all of whom are tall and not ""built like bricks"" or on the chunky side. I highly recommend these diapers."	1
You might as well wax your eyebrows with duct tape - it is cheaper and will produce the same results as this product. This stuff pulls as much skin off as it does hair, so beware.	0
On a recent visit, my daughter had lamented about the trouble that she was having finding Chuck Taylor Converse shoes in royal blue. She claimed that she and my father in law had been trying unsuccessfully for sometime to find the shoes. With my recent successes purchasing things on Amazon, I went in, found the shoes, ordered them, and before we were done with the conversation had them on their way.They arrived within the week, and she is happy, which makes me happy.	1
"possibly the worst book I have ever read...her history is not good-being English the term ""Pa will paddle my backside"" is not really something that a modern English person would say let alone someone supposedly born in the reign of King Richard. It just grated so badly that the rest of it left me cold, I love historical romances/fiction but please make some effort to get the time period even remotely correct!"	0
This is a grotesque despoliation of a classic film. Essential elements of the background storyline are not properly established. There are scenes whose purpose within the overall structure simply defies understanding. The nighttime 'escape attempt' sequence is shot in a bizarre green blur and was extremely unpleasant to watch. Hideous music plays frequently but the nail in the coffin of this film is the poverty of the in-game action sequences. These are generally nothing more than a confusing melange of images. The transitions from one camera shot to another seem very poorly done and it is really impossible to follow the internal dynamics of each game.	0
"I preordered this CD. I just listen to it for the second time. This is satire at it's most boring. Don't bother with this CD. Ry has done much more interesting stuff, both lyrically and musically. Listen to the samples before you buy. I wish I did. If you like what you hear ignore this and go with your own tastes but for me ""yuck!"""	0
While the stories are good, what made these books for me as a kid and most people I know was the artwork. MAN, they scared the crap out of me as a kid as well as everyone else. The new artwork is generic Harry Potter-esque and has none of the unadulterated creepiness the original one had. Get the ones with the original art folks, there is a whole new generation out there to be as freaked out as we were.	0
In this book, Pam finds herself having trouble with Lightning that she doesn't know why. Soon, Lightning starts getting more dangerous and gives Pam a couple more bruises. That's when it's decided to get Pam's dad involved, but what's wrong with Pam's Pony? I liked that at the beginning for once that I didn't have a clue what the problem was. Even though I am getting a little old for this series, I like the fact that these books are well written and deserved to be read.	1

"...really quite staggeringly, breathtakingly bad - unless you're particularly fond of big explosions, that is, in which case you'll absolutely love it. If you don't, prepare for a totally ridiculous tale woodenly acted without much conviction. Not even Robert Patrick's nasty chief villain can save this monumental turkey. It has but one good moment, when a minor baddie, seeing the chasing ex-Marine, says, ""He's like a Terminator"", and gets an annoyed glance from Patrick, who played the liquid metal Terminator in ""Terminator II""."	0

This cell phone holder is one of the poorest in quality I have ever seen. The Velcro or Hook and loop come un-sewn leaving your cell phone free to fall to the ground. I wouldn't recommend McGuire-Nicholas products to anyone. Their products are some of the poorest made products on the market.	0
My children, ages 1,3, 5, 7, absolutely LOVE this book (We have the board-book version). The rhyming is catchy and well-written. We live in Arizona, so they love reading about creatures we see everywhere. And they really get a kick out of finding the 'hidden' numbers. My 3 & 5-yr-old are always requesting it for bedtime storytime. They yell out the numbers as I read it, then we all count the creatures together. It's a great book for the whole family!	1
The book is a fantastic read of Orwell's projection of a future in which three totalitarian governments (all equivalent) rule the earth. I would say the book has two sections, the story, which follows an Outer Party member's struggle to rebel, and philosophy, which is Big Brother's Manifesto (or, one could say, Goldstein's but really they are one and the same). The book puts the story on hold when Winston, the protagonist, reads the manifesto; I would say that there is flow problem with the abrupt nature of this switch. Certainly the Manifesto is endemic to the book and provides another perspective and history of the rise of Oceania, the state in which Winston lives.	1
Excellent book for beginners. A must for anyone who wants to fresh taste of home made bread. Excellent photographs and guidelines. Included also is method for adapting recipes for bread machines. As the name says it recipes from all over the world like England, Mediterranean and Asia are discussed, not to mention the American and festive type breads. I love it & sure that you will too	1
Girlfriend loved them. Price was better then local area stores. She has other colors of the same shoe so they last a lifetime.	1
I've now seen the film Mean Guns twice and I have even purchased the DVD (albeit off of a bargain rack). This isn't a great film, it isn't even really a good film, but it can be entertaining if you like violence and mambo.The story behind the movie is weak at best and the cast (consisting mostly of Ice-T and Christopher Lambert) really doesn't do much to improve the film. There are some interesting action moments, all to the beat of Mambo music.If you can find it for a cheap price I'd suggest it, but I wouldn't pay any more than a couple of bucks for this film. Of course if you're a diehard Christopher Lambert fan or if you really love Mambo and Violence, this might be something you want to invest in.	0
Author doesn't believe in any biological interventions and feels you should just accept you kid's disability and get on with it. Needs to spell check his work also.	0
This book, is a personal favorite. I started to read it and could not put it down for the life of me. Mr. Steinbeck did an amazing job and has written a spectacular novella. If there were one book I could recomend to anybody, this is it. The tale of Lennie and George is one with laughter, tears(the book brought me to them), and truth about the cold heartedness that exists in the human factor.	1
I first read 20,000 Leagues Under the Sea more than 50 years ago. It was, and still is, a first rate adventure tale. Jules Verne combines action, oceanography, biology, and a bit of philosophy in this epic story. I encourage young readers to take the plunge as I did years ago and devour this novel. Older readers should experience it once again. It is a story to be enjoyed over and over again!	1
See subject line. I would never recommend this book, depth and nuance aside. It was at no point pleasant to read. I struggled to finish it.	0
This was by far the stupidest movie I've seen this year. Keanu Reeves proves yet once again that he's one of the authors of how to be a one-dimensional actor (see all the usually mediocre movies that he's done, such as Speed or one of The Matrix sequels if you don't believe me), second only to Vin Diesel (TWO DAYS. dUR-HUR-HUR!!1!111!!1!!). OK, I know I have slightly digressed and should return to the matter at hand. This movie is a desecration to the comic book, the action scenes were dumb almost to the point of sheer hilarity, that lady cop talked like a retard who got turned down from competing in the special olympics, that Satan dude looked gayer than Richard Simmon's shorts, and anyone who spent their hard-earned money to see this atrocity of a film should be entitled to a full refund.	0
Bazyn's next project should be a ransom note. This was a collection of quotes taken from other writers, pieced together, and presented as a book. I don't think there was a single paragraph that did not have a quote. It is one thing to use quotes to support your work, or to provide examples. It is entirely different, and unacceptable, for an author to use quotes to make all of the author's points.Good premise. Poor product. Disappointing.	0
Steve Berry has become one of my favourite authors. The Third Secret does not disappoint, Get ready for a thrilling ride.	1

"This book [stinks]. I read this book only, because I seen the preview for the movie. It jumps around from one thing to the next. John Keel is a nut, ""the phone rang and nobody was there!""

The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review.	0
"I have a relatively high tolerance level for bad flicks, but this one is beyond tolerable. If you check the credits after the movie it appears as if the producer hired his family and friends as the actors. Summary (no pun intended): Horrific acting (I could have acted those scenes better than the so called actors; Frightful script (who talks like that anyway ""The zombies are breaching our stronghold, I would advise that we seek an alternative egress route in order to address the impending conflict""; Brain Blending effects: Nothing like a karate kick to the face that missed by about 6 inches yet knocks the zombie through the window. My review is more interesting than this movie. Give me a camcorder and an Amazon makeup kit (shameless plug) and I could have done this movie. There is nothing redeeming about this... NOTHING!"	0
i got it for a friend since he was joining the marines and he needed to study so this was my going away present for him and he loved it i wish this guy the best	1
these diapers are basicly the same as a size 1 but the problem is that you can't get something comapable to a size 2 , I ordered size 3 after these no longer fit and the things are huge and constantly leak .hope pampers sees this and goes back to old sizing because pampers are the best for leaks etc but this stupid 1-2 combo is insane !!!	0
I would suggest a wired connection (especially for HD boxes) but if you must do the wireless, this is your best bet.	1
"This is a small bodied laser printer which ""flies"" and is a cost saver for the everyday text printing that needs no fancy color etc. Very happy, easy to use, easy to install, cartridges life makes for inexpensive running. Perfect for the student, home office and personal use. A good looking unit."	1
Man this game is horrible! I mean, the graphics are pretty good, but the fighting mode is terrible. First Frodo attacks and most likely misses! And in the Mines of Moria, there is a huge glitch. I got past it, but there is another one! This game stinks!!	1
This has to be one of the finest foreign action films I have ever seen. Kudos to the Germans on making this a fast paced, edge of your seat fantasy-action, soon to be cult- classic masterpiece. It puts forth intruiging circumstances. What if you didn't miss the bus or what if you bought that lottery ticket? In this film Lola and her boyfriend get to play out three different outcomes to almost identical situations. The dubbing to English is annoying at first but you get used to it. It is slightly off emotion. This is a great addition to your DVD collection.	1
Although this game is great, I would give it a 4.5 stars if I could. First the good: Beautiful graphics (the scenery is almost like real), the campaign has a story (unlike some RTS games that have no campaign or story), skirmish mode is fun but sometimes too quick, great gameplay, and it runs nicely. The bad: The units are sometimes kind of dumb (they stand and do nothing sometimes when they are told to go somewhere), the unit graphics could have been a little more sharp, and there aren't many units (this is not really that bad but I would have liked more units; there are 9 different combat units for the Romans). Don't let the bad things sway you from buying the game. Unless you are a real critic than the bad things would make you very mad.	1
This is exactly what I needed. I bought 2 and couldn't be happier. Keeps my shoes up off the ground, visible and neat. Love the use of space vertically. This is a well-made, sturdy, space saving shoe-a-holic's friend!	1
These bisquettes add great smoke flavor to any meat! I have been only using it a short time but the meat taste has been great.	1
I tried two linksys wireless cards and they were bad, one barely got a signal and the other one simply didn't detect my router.This one immediately did work after installing the drivers. Granted I've only had it for a week, but am very pleased. Our router is at the bedroom which is in the other end of the house (my desktop is in the bedroom opposite side) and the signal is awesome!!!	1

That sums up this collection well. It's put out by Club Med and, perhaps that says something is some people's minds. What it amounts to is a fairly non-offensive collection of big-name artists (Kool and The Gang, Wes Montgomery, Roy Ayers, Sweetback - of Sade fame) doing downtempo. Think of it as muzak that is likely played at Club Med resorts or Sandals resorts to vacationers who find Club Med still suitable (as if it somehow ever was). South Beach, Monaco, Cannes sur Mer or St. Tropez discrimnating tastes this is not.I will say that it does have packaging and style over substance, but beyond that, there are far superior products out there, literally for a fraction of the cost. Avoid this unless you have absolutely everything else in your collection and far nothing better to listen to (which I doubt).	0
The Old Grey Whistle Test hosted some incredibly groundbreaking FULL CONCERTS, two of which were the original Bob Marley and The Wailers, and Return To Forever (performing most of Romantic Warrior). Bootlegs of many of these shows are available but were recorded from nth generation tapes. Any one of these classic full shows would have been a much better choice for release than this hit and miss (mostly miss) collection of singles. I'm disappointed in this, and I believe they will be too once they see their sales numbers.	0
Questions cover, with excellent difficulty, all areas of exam 70-229. These are the style of questions all Microsoft exams should contain to maintain the credibility of their certifications.This review is a good heads up on how Microsoft is changing their exams to cover hands on work experience versus fact regurgitation. Very handy sample Exam on CD with Questions randomly generated from the Readiness Reveiw.A better publication than the 70-229 Study Kit.	1
This movie is horrible. Don't waste your money buying it or even renting it. COme on, 5 minutes of him staring at something, doing nothing? Or 5 minutes of watching the grass blowing in the wind? Art or not, it sucked horribly.	0
This book has left me wanting more. Not many books do this for me. I felt the relationshop between the sisters was very cleverly written. Who could fail to like Darcy? ? A very real person. Also Sophia - at the beginning I disliked her - then I continually liked and disliked her - I still can't make up my mind. I have given four stars because I was frustrated that we did not discover more about Alex and Darcy. I hope a second book with these characters is written.	1

This is the most informative series on Goju Ryu in print. Absolutely a must for all goju-ryu karate-ka.	1
I was really disappointed with this book, especially since it was so highly recommended by friends and in general. I guess perhaps when it was written the ideas Fromm expressed were new, or at least the way he expressed them were new, but I can't believe that any minimally self-aware person hasn't thought about at least 80 to 90 percent of these ideas themselves. Fromm seems to be the typical over-educated, intellectual psychologist/philosopher, who takes a simple idea (if you don't know and love and understand yourself and the world around you, you can't love another person) and over-analyzes it, giving historical and biblical examples. Just another 90-odd pages of psychobabble.	0
"Some people may have no issues with these diapers, however, my little girl probably leaks in these once a day if not multiple times. I've tried everything making sure that the diaper is on just right or immediately changing her when I ""hear"" her go. NOTHING WORKS - I change her outfit multiple times a day and not for the fun of it. So it is back to Swaddlers for us.....I don't know why I ever changed."	0
I recieved this book on time and in excellent condition. I'd definitely recommend this seller.	1
A PHILLY CATHOLIC IN KING JAMES COURT was an excellent book abou the catholic faith. It taught me that Mary was important and that the bread we eat at church is really Jesus. It also taught me how the amish culture in Kentucky was like. The part I didn't like though was that Michael learned the whole Catholic faith in just a couple of weeks. When it actually takes years of study to learn all those tihngs. Other than it was agood book and educational.	1
I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song...	0

"My GF bought this amp as a present for me, and now she's very unhappy. We opened the shipping box, which was 5 times the size needed, removed the amp and hooked it up. We couldn't get it to do anything advertised! Nothing hooked up to it produced any sound. Only the green ""ON"" light and the red speaker lights worked. I called the 800 number for tech support at the mfgr. of this AudiolessSource Amp 100, and, after the normal recorded voice menu, when transferred, the phone just rang and rang. No support or customer service!! It went back today!!"	0

"Walter Cronkite said that this story has ..""a power that seems to grow rather than lessen with the passage of time.""This story is even more relevant today than it ever was. If you want to understand today's events and where we might be going- READ THIS BOOK! Any thinking person will see the relevance, all of those less cerebral should still take the time and either read or listen to the audio verion of this story.I simply cannot emphasize enough how vital a part of your personal library this book should become."	1
"This movie is about nothing but nudity and sex scenes! In the first hour or so there is hardly any dialogue... just a nude scene after another. The only main dailogue is ""Take off your cloth."" And personally I don't consider this as a dialogue either.I didn't see the love story in this movie... no honest expressions. Just a man who lives a play boy life. I found this movie very boring and I even had to forward many of the sex scenes that I couldn't stand any further!Maybe if this movie had a dialogue, it would have made sense! Maybe if it was shorter! Maybe if there was less sex scenese! Maybe if there was a better (senseful) ending..!"	0
I do not know what I expected, however, after seeing this duet on TV, I was disappointed with their recording. Maybe it is just me, but I found nothing memorable here. I was bummed.	0
This book is contrived, poorly written, and far-fetched. It casts Church conservatives as evil and diabolical men trying to thwart the will of God by hiding and/or destroying the revelations from Fatima and Medjugorie. It turns out that the 'revelations' are based on God's dissatisfaction with Church doctrine in areas that liberals are always whiny about.**Spoiler below**So the repeated appearances of the Virgin Mary were due to her anger that the Church opposed homosexual marriage, abortion, female priests, and allowing priests to marry and have families. How lame and predictable. Terrible book and a waste of time.	0
Riding Logic is a fantastic, well-written, easy to understand book on riding. It's better than most current books as far as explaining riding theories. I wish I would have discovered it a long time ago but I'm very glad I have now. Museler initially discusses the rider and how many people have a misconception on what the proper seat is. Then he moves to the horse where he discusses all the stages of training from how to teach your horse to be obedient to your aids to why the horse acts out. He further explains various lessons, going through the gaits, forehand and bending exercises. Then he ends with thorough details on jumping and equipment for the rider and horse. It's just a really amazing book. I recommend it very highly!	1
To be so much in love, to try to get your loved one to fall in love with you again and again every single day... what more can I say? It's all told with Sandler's performance...	1
Good quality overall. The braket for the stem didn't fit my application, so I improvised, and mounted it behind the seat over the rear fender and low. Holds stuff.	1
Please do not buy this new edition of Scary Stories to Tell in the Dark. The publishers have completely replaced the original dark, beautiful and terrifying artwork for pictures that are clean, kid friendly and safe. They have destroyed what made this collection truly special.	0
This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children.	0
I'm such a goof! I automatically assumed that the format of this DVD was for North America Region. I was so excited when it came in, I opend the package and went straight to my player to watch. Opps! I discovered that the PAL format is not readable on my player. Though, I am aware of the many video formats out there, I still assumed that this DVD was just like any other DVD or Blue Ray that I have pruchased.The PAL is for countries like Japan and Europe, I confirmed my findings when I red the back information of the DVD package.Good thing that I have an adopted daughter in France, she will like this DVD. It's just her format! :-)Please be carefule when purchaseing video's on amazon...read carefuly that the format is for your country or else you may end up disapointed.	0
I feel that version 2.0 was one of the best cd's of the year. It should have won a grammy. as well as the first cd 2.0 delived great vocals,gutair and a good beat. there is no need to skip tracks because all of them are well tuned to the point of profection. 2.0 is a must for anyone that enjoys rock or alternative. 2.0 the bands second cd shows improvement from there first album which was also a great album.	1
The Egyptians (Ancient Peoples and Places) only as a reference on using pictures and drawings. It was almost as if Cyril didn't care to put any effort into the book, just slap down all the history he could find. He skipped over many things and put down basics. Yet it is a good guide for basic knowledge on monuments, kings, and a good place to find ancient cities of Egypt.	0
This box is very large, and contains 204 size 3 diapers. I love purchasing this product from Amazon because if I am using my Amazon Mom account, I save 30%, which makes these much less expensive than even at Wal-Mart.	1
I had to read this for school. The idea of the book at fist sounded really cool and for a moment I thought I might accually enjoy reading this story. In the end, I hated just as much as everyone else in my class. Montag's wife was annoying to me and Bradbury's ideas are really intersting. Too bad he can't write his way out of a paper bag. This book was a waste of time. Never read it unless its required and theres a test on it. Then you could make an exception, I guess.	0
Just what I wanted. A replacement for the original exhaust (that was rusted out) that sounded just alittle louder. This exhaust sounds perfect without being excessive. The bolt-on system was pretty straight forward but I did replace my catalytic converter as well.	1
If you like Five Star, get this reissue. It's nicely packaged and the sound quality is definitely an improvement from the original cd issue. The bonus tracks are not really rare though. Even in America, they are easy to find. What's missing is the a 12inch remix of Let Me Be the One. It's called the 'dance remix' and was on some 12-inch's with the Philadelphia remix, depending on which catalog number was on the picture sleeve. Anyways, it's a slamming remix that mixed All Fall Down in the intro and includes scratching, sampling, and a different sax solo. That version would have made this reissue a MUST BUY!	1
"While the ideas that lay the framework for this book are solid, everything else is lacking.The humor is forced, awkward, and on occasion plagarized. A nearly verbatim quote from a Monty Python sketch stands out in my mind.The plot is slow and seldom rivetting. The only thing that kept me turning the pages at some points was my search for the origin of the ""REMIND ME AGAIN HOW THE HORSE-SHAPED ONES MOVE"" quote.The character development is poor. The main character, Brutha, makes a sudden transition from a bumbling idiot to a sagely leader-of-men and bargainer-with-gods. I wasn't convinced.The ideas, however, are the salvation of this book. Read it if you have a good imagination...you'll need it to make up a new story around the concept Pratchett so poorly utilizes."	0
So if nobody understands what the heck the author is trying to say means that the book rates five stars? I think not.	0
"""If these guys can't fix it, Hell no one can."" After a group of scientists goes missing, the army hires an elite covert team led by Tyler (Sorbo) to go and investigate and rescue them. When they get to the site they discover something they never could have imagined. There really is not much to say about this movie. The best way to explain it is that this is a Scy/Fy channel version of ""Predators"". It is only missing the effects, action, cool bad guys and acting, other then that it is a lot like ""Predators"". If you are a HUGE Predator or Sci-fi fan you would probebly like this, otherwise go ahead and aviod this and anyone who wants you to watch it. I give it a D.Would I watch again? - No way! I will not be getting this for my store.*Also try - Predators"	0
The shrink wrap was still on the CD needless to say I was impressed this is the very definition of new 5 stars for sure	1
Dumb down adaptation to the great vertigo horror comic book lacks the flare and the heart of the book and dumbs down the subject matter in order to please Keanu Reeves's fan base. Keanu can't act if his life depended on it and the script is not worth its weight of tissue paper. The acting by most of the cast is almost as bad as Keanu's with the excerption of Rachel Weisz, who gives the only real and compelling performance in the entire movie and to Djimon Hounsou, who is the only actor in the film who does his comic book character justice. Other than their performances, the movie is not worth your time.	0
This gunk will breath an extra few months out of the soles even the most beat up, falling apart shoes in your closet. For $6 or so you won't have to replace them so soon, just squeeze some of this goo into the damaged area and let it sit for 24 hours: Presto, a waterproof bond that will hold up until you are ready to buy a new pair.	1
When i started this book i had no idea that it would lead me to read the next four. two thumbs up.	1
I received this scale just last week, and I am happy to report that it is everything I expected. I was sick of spending money on expensive digital (inconsistent) models, that stopped working after only a year or so of use. This unit provides consistent readings at eye level. It was simple to complete assembly of the two main pieces shipped in the box, and was simple to balance (and rebalance as necessary if the scale is moved).	1
The directions to put this together were unclear and failed to note that you need to use really oversized bags. After a few uses the sides have already broken. The clips are really hard to put on and off the the rack.	0
"The springs on this toy are extremely tight, making it very difficult for babies and toddlers to operate.

Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!	1
"The dress is absolutely adorable. I ordered this dress along with a back-up,(strapless satin tulle prom dress with black lace trim) from this company, as a destination wedding dress. I placed my order late Thursday night and received both in the mail the following Monday...proof that in-stock items are shipped out ASAP. The quality of work/material is very nice on both styles. (thick satin, fully lined, no flaws)I didn't notice if they stated in the description, but the dresses are made in USA. Also, I am very pleased with the fit. If you are unsure or uneasy about ordering a size, go by the size chart measurements. They are completely accurate. It is hard to tell about the length in the pics, I am 5'4"" and the dress falls mid-calf, tea-length. I am very pleased with both dress' styles, prices, and the company. I definitely recommend ordering items from Pacifiplex."	1
Not much dharma going on here. But lots of bum. In fact, I'm totally bummed out finishing this novel because now I feel very uncool to not be enamoured with this bible of the beat generation but I, just, don't, get, it. So much rambling! Excruciatingly long sentences perfunctorily reporting things as they happen in the style of `then he said this and then I picked that up and then she went outside...' [Insert yawn here]. There are glimpses of good authorship in some parts of the novel but for the most part it is unbelievably boring with a monotonic narrator's voice that had me re-discovering my speed-reading skills just to finish the thing. Disappointing because I love a good story and I love Eastern philosophy but this is neither. Unless you're an impressionable teenager who thinks bumming around is cool and everything your friends think is cool, and anything indie is cool, forget it.	0
"Call me a philistine, but ""Candide"" did more to confuse than enlighten me. Yes, I know the story is deliberately far fetched, almost surreal, but it still failed to make an impact even when considering the work in this context. Absurdity can only travel so far.My sad but brief review is that ""Candide"" is less meaningful today that it was at the time of its writing. No, I have not found the meaning of life but nor has Voltaire."	0
Oversize and they pinch my legs. I had to trim the top 1/2 inch off the boots to keep my legs from bleeding they hurt so bad. Cheap Crap but a notch better than Walmart boots.	0
Both sad and hilarious at the same time, this book is a must read for anyone who wonders at our current criminal justice policy. Almost four decades of the drug war have produced no discernable reduction in drug use, but loads of folks in prison and a steady erosion of our constitutional rights.	1
Product was exactly what I was looking for. I could not find it anywhere, but on Amazon.	1

Kudos to Farwell for his insightful biography of one of the most charismatic figures of the 19th century British Empire. Richard Francis Burton has always been one of my personal heroes and the author has done a fine job of bringing the exploits and foibles of this extrordinary soldier, spy, rogue, linguist, explorer, and author, to light.	1
It was a wicked book just very emotional it was great in the sense of friendship between too people. I would recommend the book to just about anyone.	1
Sony outdid themselves with this camera. It has all the digital effects you need in a cam corder with the ability to take still shots at a touch of the button. The dv tape is small and easy to carry around. It holds both the digital pictures and the video on the same film. This makes it easy to record in both modes when at an affair. The result is a video record with 5 second sound bites when still shots are used. Comes with a good grouping of transfer methods from firewire to svideo to infra red. Movies can be quickly loaded onto computer and easy to edit.	1
Having read this book previously by borrowing it from the library i decided to buy the book. The only place i could find it was at Amozon. com. I was very impressed at the array of books and the speed of Delivery.The book its self is a wonderful representation of the time of Christmas and I would recommend it to anybody for its factual representation of that time.	1
Wow! It's like they transplanted someone from Kansas to the epitone of hip cities. There is no sweat, no sips on a hurricane. There is no funk! This is not a city that can be described from the passerby. You might know the names, know the places, but you ain't experienced a thang. You gotta step on a Coke cap and do a little soft shoe. You gotta bar hop, swipe your brow with a hanky in a smoky club where the jazz is the only thing hotter than the weather. You gotta suck a neck of a crawldaddy, eat rice and beans on laundry day. This is a city of great storytellers, and this ain't one of them!	0
This is just abysmal... Taking what was THE definitive horror trilogy for the 90s and changing the artwork because tightwad parents disapproved. Don't let your kids read the books if you don't like them, but ruining it for EVERY kid born after 2000? What a sign of the times... Family Guy/American Dad in the Simpsons spot, Twilight saga in the X-Files spot, Hunger Games sweeping Battle Royale under the rug, and now this...	0
This is a very sturdy mount. It is extremely heavy and as other reviewers have noted, it is complicated to setup. The one big drawback is how far out the TV sticks when you have the mount completely pushed in. We wound up buying another mount that sat more flush to the wall. I would recommend a different mount unless you need something this sturdy that can rotate the TV verticle.	0
This toy is sooo cool!When you think of an item in your head and answer yes,no,unknown,or sometimes it eventually figures it out!I was playing it for an 1 hour and it got it right every time.It's amazing how it figures it out and it's great time consuming toy for travel and stuff.	1
I purchased this Sony VCR at a Target, thinking you can rely on Sony, well I was wrong. It did not record a very good quality picture from my TV (cable). I tried switching tapes, and recorded in both EP and SP, but there was always some kind of disturbance seemingly from one particular point in the reel/head/whatever. It occurred regularly in playback, about every few seconds at the beginning of the tape, and then occurring in shorter intervals toward the end of the tape. Oh, and I used new Sony tapes, which did fine on my older Sony VCR...go figure, but don't buy it.	0
Outstanding history from Robert E. Lee's most important aide. Tremendously insightful into Lee and the ANVA	1
In a lot of ways it does show its age, but most everything about the game is still very fun and pretty addicting.	1
I read this for a college course. If this is the best the world had to offer at the time (Pulitzer Prize winner), then I fear for this nation. It was confusing at the beginning (conflicting ideas presented - it speaks as if it were the beginning of the world, but the characters find ancient items). And the story line is jumbled.Personally, I found no enjoyment in the reading of it. The symbolizism that we were supposed to find was buried so deeply that I had to research it on the internet. I finally found a few things written on the symbolism, had to re-read most of the book to find it, and consummed quite a bit of headache medicine to get through it.It was far too long for what it had to say...which wasn't much. Never have I burned a book in my life. I took special joy in planning an overnight camping trip for the sole purpose of watching it burn.	0
Works great, fits better. Works with a range of headsets. I use it with a jawbone iciness and a jabra extreme. The gels are comfortable, and fit quite well. Before buying these I was seriuosly thinking of a custoel. Th ese are almost the well fitting. Biggest issue is that the material hardens and may need replaced in about 6 months, but for the price I can live with that.	1
I bought the ZR45MC camcorder in Sept '02. I have been using it quite regularly. then all of a sudden I cannot load new or old mini DV cassettes. The moment I load a cassette, a message flashes on the screen 'REMOVE TAPE' and beeping sound is generated together with a flashing 'EJECT' message. Next step, I ship this to the Canon Factory service in NJ. They replied with an estimate of $160(on top of the $654 I pad for this!!).Also most importantly when I shipped from the Fedex office in Boston, the Fedex person made a remark that she has been seeing quite a number of the Canon camcorders going to NJ for repairs.To sum, I think this is a racket Canon has devised to rip off customers.So beware when you buy a Canon camcorder, ask the retailer about the tape loading mechanism, and if they have any maintenance plans that will repair it.	0
"The first edition came out in 1998 and, six years on, this work has not been surpassed for its importance as an analysis of WWII joint warfighting, the Luftwaffe's way of war, airpower in the Crimea, airpower in the Caucasus, airpower at Stalingrad, and naturally the Stalingrad airlift itself.The reasons for this book's immediate ""classic"" status are easy to pick: totally accurate citing of hundreds of never-before-used sources in several languages drawn from major archives; a highly original approach to the writing of campaign histories; a clear argument; a fair and balanced approach; no Wehrmacht-devotee comments or tone (all too common I'm afraid); a wonderfully readable writing style; and precise footnotes that help the reader to determine the reliability of all claims or statements.A true model of a WWII campaign analysis. VERY highly recommended!"	1
A fascinating look at a young man who is beginning to question his youthful ideals. Does he abandon his lower class family and everything he believes to marry into a wealthy family? It is beautifully written and very real.	1
This pocket size book attempts to teach the reader basic phrases and sentences in Danish by printing them phonetically in English. This is a great concept- but instead of spelling things foe-net-ik-lee, they use all of those annoying symbols that one generally finds in a pronunciation key at the begining of an american dictionary (the upside down and backwards e, the little lines over an a or an e, etc. for example). So unless you are an English major and understand the meaning of these american language symbols- you will never understand this book. Also, even when you try to figure out what all the symbols mean- the pronunciation that you end up with sounds nothing like the danish word. My husband is from Denmark and I have been struggling with the language for years.

mergovian nights was the original series this muddled piece of work is based on. entire chapters and plots are lifted from those books, its unreal.the original books are much better, the loss of Retribution Jones, turning her into a minor wimpy character, was a great loss of a strong voice. i found most of the characters a poor imitation of the original series.having been to venice, i can state this book did not take me there, i had trouble belivieng it was venice, not paris.M lackey has written some fine books, why she put her name on this is a mystery.	0
let the high preists of deconstructionist post modernism interpret it for you. bow down before the wisdom of frustrated ineffectual professors of English, the preistly class who will interpret this message from the gods for you, (and actually get pay and respect for it). lets get real. this is a book by a sciziphrenic for the pompous and pedantic. a few puns aside dont waste your life trying to interpret this nonsense, just because you have an ego. (even Nobel laureates fell for it--hence the quark, but FASHIONABLE NONSENSE is the delayed reaction)the real dope: read: WHAT ART IS. MADNESS AND MODERNITY. and THE FOUNTAINHEAD. for some insight into why nonsense like this continues to propagate.	0
"This book was a fast read, and coupled with the fact that I really couldn't put it down, it was a really fast read.CS Lewis is one of my favorite authors, I have many of his books, and currently have a few more on my ""to be read"" shelf. I love the way that he can be a cogent and articulate theologian in such works as Mere Christianity, but then he can switch hats and write wonderful works of fantasy, which have strong undertones of Christianity such as the Chronicles of Narnia (I really need to go back to those, because the more I read snippets of them, the more I realize just how Christian they are), or the Space Trilogy, or this book.What CS Lewis has done here is to take the classical Greek myth of Cupid and Psyche, and rework it. Now one might say, well that myth is a classic, why mess with a classic? Well, read the book and find out. In a way he reworked it, but in another way he wrote an entirely new story unto its own."	1
"1984 On september the 6.th someone said that Orwell never read, and therefore was not inspired by ""We"". That is not true. I have got a rewiew of ""we"" that Orwell wrote in 1947. Besides, I have read a danish translation of Samjatins novel, and there are loads of parralels. But still I regard 1984 as one of the greatest, and most visionary, novels of modern times."	1
I have always dug Dolly Parton&this Double Disc Set is a must have for any Newbie getting into Dolly's Work.

Assembly was pretty straight forward, and when you're all done with the TV on top ... looks pretty slick. Strap in back secures TV, and cover in front does the same.Due to support beams in back, my receiver had to go right in the middle on the 2nd shelf. Those same beams, could possibly get in the way of wiring on the top shelf if putting components two across. In fact, I need to get a couple of right-angle connectors in my case. There is also a chance since the glass is at an angle on the sides, that one foot of a componenent all the way to either side may not touch the glass. I also wish the top shelf was a little taller for stacking components.Even with these quibbles, I am very happy with the stand, because the quality is very nice, and the end result looks great & feels solid.	1
This is a great movie and a visually stunning one -- so it's worth having in a Blu-ray edition. The sexual content is not as shocking as it was when the film was first released, but it's still an emotionally powerful and unnerving work.	1
Very bad Keanu Reeves horror film is a real look at how much a vanity project can spiral out of control. Keanu Reeves is just out of place in supernatural tale about a private eye that helps a cop look into the suicide of her twin sister. The special effects are not of top quality and the script is too jumbled to even try to figure out what is going on from time to time. The rest of the acting is decent with Rachel Weisz stealing the show and giving this movie more than her fair share of heart and talent and Peter Stormare doing more in his brief cameo that most of the other actors in the film. Unfortunately nether Weisz or Stormare can over come the hack like script which treats their characters and the story of the film as a joke. I like a good popcorn film but this is not one of them.	0
"I got this book by accident, I was in a group of books that a coworker left for to look through. And after reading it I was just captivated by it all and wanted to read more of julie garwoods book. The story was just wonderful and all that I love to see in stories.I loved how ms garwood told the story about guillans father and his death and how her and her sister were talken away. It was wonderful and helped later in the book to already understand things and not have to wait to find out why this or that was going to happen.My favorite part of this book was when guillan finds out that she was married on a horse. "" A horse, I was married on a horse""? It was just perfect..I look forward to reading all of Ms. garwoods book and hope that she will be writing for a long time to come."	1

These diapers work very well for my little boy, they are comfortable and very absorbent. He's been wearing the Baby Dry Diapers for several months now and he hasn't had any problems with irritations. The packaging is also really handy, inside each box are 3 plastic sleeves with diapers; it makes it easy to take some to the grandparents or a sitter.	1
The pen was shipped promptly. This is the classic Montblanc pen that everyone raves about. It is Black in color with Golden Trim. It holds it's own and I am thankful to my parents to gift this to me as a Graduation Present. Someday I plan on buying more of these pens from Amazon.The vendors at Amazon are amazing. I have been a long time shopper at Amazon, mostly pens and electronics. However this pen was gifted to me by my mom and she has nothing but good things to say. I on my part love this pen.	1
"Buyer Beware: My Mom Loves her Mailstation but hers broke. I was So thrilled to see Amazon still offered them for sale!

i watched this movie and thought it was hilarious i didnt go five minutes without laughing. I loved all the random animals that kept popping up, and i especially loved the way the french chick instantly started talking like a mongoloid while she was learning english.

"After racking my brains trying to read William Faulkner, I decided to give this short, simple, touching story a try. Steinbeck is a great author to read after Faulkner; his easiness of style cures the headache Faulkner's vortexes of plot development cause. This novel, which was written to read like a play, contains the memorable characters of George and Lennie. Lennie's phrase, ""Are we gonna have rabbits George?"" has been immortalized. This story is easy to read and enjoyable; however, one cannot help to sympathize with the loneliness of all its characters. I recommend this book, but I classify it in the ""Literature Light"" section of the books I've read."	1
with regards to sound, this is a very good headsetThe noise cancelling features are very good ---- unfortunately, the 'phones suffer from discomfort and priceI compared these headphones, head to head, on an airplane, against the Sony MDR NC20, and there was no difference in sound - both performed excellently, and equally, within the airplane environment ---- however, the Sony ones were more comfortable and MUCH cheaperDon't even waster your time with the Bose Quite Comfort ---- grab a pair of the Sony's and you'll fall in love!	0
Super stupid Keanu Reeves monster movie that is so bad, I'm waiting for it to come on Mystery Science Theater 3000. Keanu is at his worse with this film and it shows on his face that even he thinks the movie is bad. Out of the entire cast, Only Rachel Weisz(Runaway Jury) and Peter Stourmar(Bad Boys 2) give credible performances that are way better than the movie itself. Rachel Weisz does more with her part than the screenwriters and the director did with making the movie and gives the film an unnecessary great performance that a way better movie could have used instead and Peter Stourmar gives class and dignity to an underwritten role that is only in the movie for about five minutes.See it for Rachel Weisz and Peter Stourmar ONLY, because the rest of the film is really bad.	0
What the ..... is this hand drawn basic illustration junk?Must have had his kid do the drawing or something.This book is a total rip off and that's being super kind. not a single useful new idea or jig.Books like this makes you not want to ever buy another book.one star only Because couldn't do zero star.Straight into trash!!!	0
Molly Gloss has written an incredible tale of a pioneer woman who settles in the wilds of the Oregon frontier. To classify this book as a 'western' is to diminish not only the story but the excellent prose that Ms Gloss has given to the reader. Lydia Sanderson,the heroine of this story, is an example of the thousands of women who settled the western United States,surmounting extreme conditions, with or without a man. This story is told from the thoughts and perspectives of human beings in a time when words were important and not just 'bantied about' without thought.The book gives one, in this high tech day and age, a sense of the real and important, in daily living. It puts ones feet back on the ground and gives a new perspective to our lives. Thank you Molly Gloss for this heroic woman and the encouragement she is to women today.	1
"Don't buy this scanner, if you want to use the ADF to scan multiple pages into one document. The ""SCANDIRECT"" software that ships with this product WILL NOT scan multiple pages into one document. When you feed 5 pages into the ADF (automatic document feeder) thinking you'll get one document with 5 pages ---WRONG.. you get 5 documents with one page each.Just UPGRADE your paperport software for a minimum of $100, and then you can use the scanner as it was designed. When I called to complain to XEROX about this, I was told that they had ""mated"" this scanner and the software (Version 9) before the ADF was added as part of the base scanner. Seemed pretty crappy to me. IT GOING BACK to the store tomorrow."	0
love to download free classic books but I don't like being required to write a certain number of words to post a review.	1
I have read most of this series with great delight. However, Pratchett finally let me down.It plods along, in no particular hurry to let the reader move on to better things.The humor -- what little there is of it -- is forced. It has the feel of sophomore philosophy majors sitting 'round the Quad on a Saturday night, dateless and full of mockery. It is kind of sad.Far from one of his best. PYRAMIDS, any of the series having to do with the Watch or the wondrous three witches -- you will enjoy those far more.This one droops as limply as an Ayn Rand novel.	0
Don't have enough time or money for Childbirth classes? Are the classes full? Watch this video instead! Really thorough and informative. It has the same information as classes for about a tenth of the price.	1
"While this is a fairly well written book anyone that has ever been connected to Manson, Manson's followers, or the Manson case has said there was no way that Charles Manson had ANYTHING to do with this book.First of all, Manson, while speaking makes NO sense whatsoever.Secondly, If anyone has ever seen Manson's written word, not only does it not make any sense, but it's not legible.Third, The ""frame"" that the wording is in, does not sound like anything I have ever seen, read, or heard from Manson.Fourth, Manson himself has denied having anything to do with this book since it was being written, through publication, through all the years since.Some of the information in this book is factual, based upon trial transcripts, and conversations that are documented elsewhere. However the words that are attributed to Manson, in my opinion were the author's own words. Not a bad read, but not something I would recommend to someone looking for the 'truth'."	0
This story was quite sad initially but turned out OK in the end, I always think it very sad when families cannot respect and like each other.	1

These brush picks really work. If you want to clean between teeth and massage gums, this is certainly an effective way.	1
Once we figured out that you needed to add a teaspoon of water to the gumbase before you microwave it it was a lot of fun. The instruction say to pour off excess water but neglect to tell you to add water in the first place. My son and his freids had a blast making their own custom gums. I had to help with the kneeding process but over all I think it's a great product for kids who like their gum. You can substitute splenda for the powdered sugar if you want to make sugar fee gum too.	1

This is a lovely movie set in the stunning beauty of Tuscany. It deftly explores several types of relationships from that of a recent divorcee, to the break up of a gay union to young lovers in a Romeo and Juliet type romance. The divorcee finally discovers that a meaningful relationship doesn't depend on one person but a variety of people. Well worth seeing - you will enjoy it!	1
"Have you ever sat amongst friends, or maybe even strangers, and swapped stories with each person attempting to make their tale appear to be the most impelling. This is in essence the design of Geoffrey Chauncer's ""Canterbury Tales"", a collection of stories told by a group of travelers on a pilgrimage to Canterbury Cathedral. Of these stories the most noted are ""The Knight's Tale"", ""The Wife of Bath's Tale"", ""The Miller's Tale"", ""The Reeve's Tale"", and ""The Parson's Tale"". Chaucer, born in the early 1340s (the exact date is unknown), lived a most notable life and had a profound impact on English literature. Much of his works are influenced by love and his distain for the Church in the form of satirical humor. The latter due impart to the corruption within the clergy and the condition of the people from their suffering of drought, famine, and disease. Chaucer's work brought to light a new age of literature full of wit, comedy, and daily life."	1
I was hesitant to do digital purchase. But 3 months later, still good. Have watched it 4+ times and still have option of porting it to two different devices. A great movie to own and watch again and again.	1
I loved swaddlers but they are only in small sizes so I moved to baby dry. Well with teething there is diarrhea and even when I ran to the changing table to change him after an audible bm it was on it's way out of the top back of the diaper and the sides, also I bought them thinking they had the flexible side panels, which are wonderful because you don't feel like your cutting off your babies circulation if you want them snug. I must have received an older box and it did not have the flexible sides. I have since switched to cruisers and love them.	0
I bought this book for my first PHP college class. I had only dabbled in PHP, so I was in no way ready for this book. While the book is very large, it fails to go indepth for explanations. I tend to learn well by a book staying with a program and going through into detail what to do and then expanding on that program throughout. This book is only useful for referencing.	0
This was one of my favorite books assigned in school this year. I like the exciting adventures of this cannon trek from Fort Ticonderoga to Cambridge, MA. I liked how they crossed the ice with all of those big guns. When the last gun crossed, the ice cracked, but they were able to get the big gun out.	1
I got all four Discovery HD DVD's. Brazil and China work fine on my ToshibaA-2. Italy and Australia do not. I returned them to Amazon and the replacements did not work either. Then I started reading and found many otherpeople with the same problem which is caused by a coding problem with thesetwo disc's. These two will go back tomorrow. It's a shame Discovery did sucha poor job making sure these disc's were playable especially considering howfew different models of HD DVD Players there are out on the market.	0
"I am a fan of Musiq - don't get me wrong. I really liked his first two albums, so I was thoroughly outraged when I bought/heard ""Soulstar"". Nowhere on the same level! It lacks so much of the ""soul"" that ironically labels it. Honestly, pick up ""Dwele - Subject"" or ""Kem - Kemistry"" instead. This album is not hot, don't believe the hype! And whoever said that Musiq in on the same level as Maxwell, must be deaf! At any rate, the best song on the entire album is ""forthenight"" (for the night), which they play so frequently on the radio. If you're curious, let one of your friends lend it to you (if they have it), or ask them to burn it for you... I wouldn't recommend blowing your hard-earned moolah on this soul-less atrocity. ;o("	0
I bought these. After two uses (the first being a french vanilla cake, and the second fudge brownies), they stained from the brownie batter and will not come clean. I figured these would be better quality, since they ARE kitchen aid.	0
"Magnum's ""Vigilante"" is their most commercial sounding album, and it might as well be their finest effort ever. Some would say it's time typical and some will say that it has little in common with the early Magnum. Well, that might be the case but the fact is that this album is very good - strong material, well performed and well produced. Magnum deliver quality rock with a lot of melody from the start to the end. You get rockers as well as ballads, and Magnum have not included a single filler on this solid album. Highly recommended!"	1
I've only started using the Emu Oil. It does feel like something that's really good for my skin. I don't know that I look 30 years younger. . maybe that will come with time LOL.	1
"Queen's ""Hot space"" is very different from the classic and excellent albums from the 1970's. The overall approach is more pop than rock. The opening ""Staying power"" is pop-disco with a pumping bass and some horns, and is kind of a declaration of what to expect this time from Queen. Regardless of musical style, Queen are so talented that they do it with class and quality whether it's heavy metal or pop. On this album John Deacon's bass plays a major role on the behalf on Bran May's guitar and even if I would prefer a more guitar oriented album, Freddy Mercury sings as good as always. The melody and the groove is usually there and songs like ""Back chat"" are very good indeed. But of course there's a couple of tunes I don't think stand up to former heights. The closing number ""Under pressure"" is a duet with David Bowie and in regard of the other songs on this album it falls kind of natural."	0
I looked through this book and found it to be very educational as far as various life lessons a child may need to learn. Really I do just want to point out that Larry Potter was copyrighted far before Harry Potter and that by saying it is a copycat is highly inaccurate and unfair. They are entirely different types of stories and styles and are aimed at entirely different audiences. So, if you are planning to buy this book for someone over the age of 5, they probably will not find it very entertaining. Otherwise, it's a great book for early readers.	1
Once again, way way way overhyped! I really expected this to be the best Batman movie yet. OMG was I wrong! I had to fight to stay awake through the first hour, it was so boring. I think Christian Bale sucked as Batman. It's hard to even express how stupid the Batmobile looked! And what was with Batman talking like dirty Harry? The best parts of this movie, were shown on the commercials. If Christian Bale plays Batman in the sequel, at least I'll know not to waste any money seeing it.	0
"These Milwaukee router bits are presently being clearanced out by multiple sellers, and they appear to be identical to Freud's premium router bits (but without the red paint). As such they can be an excellent bargain. You get a very nice Italian made bit for Chinese bit prices.Be warned, however, that this bit would more accurately be called a 1/4"" shank bit with a 1/2"" by 1"" cutter. The 2-5/8"" description is misleading at that refers to the entire bit length including the shank. For my purposes (at at the closeout bargain price), the 1"" cutter length is fine ... but be sure you know what you are getting."	1
I thought it was pretty bad. Hostel was better than this crap. I mean it was ok in some parts but I didn't expect much. It's not even scary. I can't wait to watch Hostel 2 when it comes out.	0
There is no other book on Africa, or Arabia, like this one! Like in his other books, Childress rambles from place to place looking for mysteries, lost cities, and adventure. If you are looking for some dry fossil hunter story, this isn't it. It's the only book that I know of that covers such unusual topics as port cities in the middle of the Arabian Desert, the history of the Ark of the Covenant, the giant megaliths of the Kalahari Desert and other little-discussed topics. Lots of old maps, photos and illustrations. It is a fun book to browse through as well.	1
"A co-worker kept saying how great this CD was and how great Clay's voice was and that I would not regret buying this one, and she was so right. What a talent this young man is! I just can't listen to it enough.. Although its hard to pick a favorite out of all the awesome songs, I would have to say track #10 ""Perfect Day"" is my favorite. But you will find yourself singing along with all of them. Great job on a debut CD. Clay Aiken's voice is phenomenal, and he is what today's music needs."	1
This is just an album full of oversung sappy, cheesy lyrics. Horrible production from the AI machine. Where do they find these songwriters?And could Clay over enunciate a little more?Yes, he won't sing about sex, but he's singing about being invisible and watching someone in their room. <@@> Scary!	0
I got this product in April and exactly two months later it said my subscription had expired and I needed to renew in order to keep receiving updates for antivirus protection.I wrote to the company and a week later they sent me a reply. The reply was to go to their update center and to renew.

Though this story was written in a unique voice, it is not the great classic that everyone claims it is. It often wandered and was full of characters who's personality and dialogue (not to mention names) were all so similar that you could hardly tell them apart.Let's be honest, it's only trendy to read this right now because it was featured on Oprah's Book Club. Don't believe the hype.	0
Ross Leckie writes exciting, thrilling storys, but a writer should not work in historical fiction if he doesn't know anything about the period is writing. Every time ross goes for some detail...it's COMPLETELY WRONG...he dont even know that a primus pilus (primipilus) is the first centurion of the first cohort. If you want to read historical novels about rome, try Steven Saylor or the marvelous Colleen McCullough. Mr. Ross, You don't have to be a scholar to write historical fiction, but please...read one or two books before you write your novels.	0
I am so disappointed in these diapers. They are cheap and plasticy feeling. Also, They are not absorbant at all. I thought all Pampers diapers were wonderful until these.

"Real boring, that is! (You see how I did that, right, using the ""keeps it real"" phrase to hook you into reading the next line and then BAM just like Emeril Lagasse). An absolutely irredeemable mess from start to finish, and a movie that made me suspect that Mr. Van Sant got lucky with Drugstore Cowboy despite his lack of talent. But that isn't really fair, since he also directed To Die For and Milk, both of which were outstanding. So maybe this was a fluke; maybe he was hung over the day he made this, since it couldn't have taken more than a day to cobble this mess together, right? It was much easier to make than it was to watch, I'll tell you that much."	0

We bought this DVD[ASIN:B00005JPH2 The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian] right before the holidays. So far, my family has watched at least half a dozen times. On one of our 7 hours drive to a ski resort, my kids (13 and 12 yrs old) watched both of the Narnia DVD (White Witch and Prince Caspian) back to back. They really liked both DVDs, though my daughter think that the first DVD (White witch) has a prettier Narnia (snow, everything).The Prince Caspian DVD add a bit Shakespear drama to the story. The actors are very good, especially the one playing Miraz.Highly recommend this to any Narnia fans!	1
The bluray arrived at my house within 3 business days of purchase even with the using the cheapest style of shipping. The discs and box were in good condition as described. The ninth season has some hard to follow spots that do not get explained right off. Has a couple of slow spots as well. Otherwise as a whole the series and this season were well written with a good story line.	1

"Ms. Browne seems to be well meaning when describing her experiences and her dreams and those of others. However, the books spends more time discussing Ms. Browne's views about herself rather than focusing on the more interesting information about dreams themselves.It is obvious from reading the book that Ms. Browne is a lay person and a ""spiritual guide"", not a scientist of any kind. I would venture to guess that most of the information she provides is based on her own opinions and conjecture rather than hard, sounds facts.I was very disappointed with this book, and only ""dream"" of getting my money back . . ."	0
Hughes' translation seems as rich, exciting & electric to modern readers as the original text must have been to audiences a century ago. It avoids the stiff awkwardness that former English translations have been known for, while still remaining true to Wedekind's dark symbolism and expressionistic overtones. A must-read for theater-lovers and practictioners alike.	1
I finished the Kindling last night, and loved it soooo much. The cliffhanger really made me want to read more. This is a really great book to read anytime, for anything. I suggest that anyone who wants a good book should read the Kindling.	1

"I went to two stores trying to find the exact brand name products that Sandra Lee insist we use. Frustrated, I asked the store mananger who told me that the products I was looking for, Campbell's fat-free mushroom soup and Jello refrigerated vanilla pudding cups are no longer available in my area.Why make such a big fuss about using this or that brand when they aren't even available? I won't waste any more time travelling around town looking for the exact brand names needed to make the recipes in this book.I have better things to do! Maybe this book needs a ""use-by "" date before even more products become obsolete."	0

"This product is fantastic for those whose climate never varies by more than one degree. When I saw the name ""Timex"" I was somewhat apprehensive but said to myself, ""How can they mess up a thermometer?"". I don't know how they did it but they did, big time. Admittedly, for $5.99 I didn't expect a device approved by the National Weather Service but this product is overpriced by about $5.98. Rather than going through the hassle of returning it I joyously took a hammer to it and took out many inner frustrations. I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."	0
Will my future change because of this one second I stopped to look at this dress in the window? Will I alter other peoples' lifes by bumping into them? - You have never asked yourself those questions? Well, you certainly will after seeing this movie. 'Run Lola Run', a German movie, is fantastically made and keeps your heart beating rapidly down to the last second of it. Lola's boyfriend got into trouble. And now Lola has 20 minutes to get 100,000 German Marks. The phone hits the floor and Lola starts running... Americans, who are usually not very fond of foreign movies, should not let the 'dubbed' stop them. Dare to watch it and a race is waiting for you. Tom Tykwer created a 90 minute video clip. Fast, unstopable, exciting. And the one minute you spent thinking about getting this movie will change your life.	1
This is a fascinating and detailed examination of the evolution of Israel from the perspective of early Zionist aspirations, through to the Hagannah and the IDF. Morris clearly has access to high quality IDF intelligence and archives. While many reviewers have focused on the Arab vs. Zionist sections of the book - presumably because these tensions feed naive political emotions - the text itself devotes a large amount of space to the double dealing by Britain that sowed the seeds of much of the current conflict. In my opinion, an understanding of international subterfuges plotted against, and subsequently thwarted by, a nascent Israel is proably the primary added value of this text. Irrespectove of one's ideological stance, Morris draws together a compelling account of the injustices directed at the early state of Israel (Yishuv). Well worth reading. Packed with detail and certainly not propaganda.	1
My rescue dog had pretty bad separation anxiety. I wanted to try this to see if it would ease some of the symptoms associated with separation anxiety. I didn't see any difference. I tried two of these, thinking that it might take a little longer, but it never really help my dog.It still might be worth a try for your dog. I can say that it certainly didn't hurt!If your dog is suffering, I still think it's worth a try.	0
In my honest opinion, this was one of the best books I have ever read. Its unique setting, plot, and characters make for an unforgettable read. The emotional roller coaster that King Rat takes you through is phenomenal. One minute, you could feel dire hatred toward the King because of his treatment of his fellow POWs. The next, you could be laughing hysterically due to the idea of Colonel Smedly-Taylor paying top dollar for rat legs. After that, you would be feeling sorrow and pity toward the King. No book I have read before has left such a lasting impression on me. After I was finished, I almost wished I were just beginning it so I could experience the ride all over again. I highly recommend it for anyone who wants a thoughtful, impacting story. James Clavell will forever hold a fond place in my heart.	1
The antenna, while being a bit large, does work rather well. It is highly directional so you will have to move it around somewhat. It is styled well and sturdy. I have it sitting on top of my sat receiver and it looks good where it sits. This antenna, by the way, is built by Winegauard, a longtime American antenna company.	1
wrong book sent. Customer service was poor and presented an extremely difficult procedure for correcting the problem. I was required to pay to send the book back, mailing back cost almost as the book itself. Even complying with this process did not ensure a replacement, but only that the order would be checked.	0
"I AM SO DISSAPOINTED WITH THE NEW BABY DRY DIAPERS .I have been using Pampers cruisers for my son and have rarely had any leakage ..Maybe an occassional leak which is not bad.I was happy with Pampers.I decided to give ""Baby Dry"" a try bcos it claimed to have a more absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I am sooo disappointed. The core seems to be WAAAAAYYY inferior to the Cruisers core and leaks !! I started using them a few days back and my son has woken up atleast 5 nights crying bcos he was soaking wet !! :(This morning I was holding him and my shirt felt wet. The diaper was leaking and it went thru his clothes onto mine !! So its not just about night time leaks. So much for absorbent core to prevent night time leaks.I was better off with my tried and trusted Cruisers.NEVER HAD SUCH A BAD CASE OF LEAKS WITH CRUISERS .......WILL NEVER USE BABY DRY DIAPERS AGAIN.I hope Pampers is not dropping its quality :("	0
I am sincerely happy with my purchase of this book. It is wonderful. The pictures are clear and labeled well. This is a great book to study off of. Way clearer than alot of textbooks that i have tried to study anatomy off of. It is simple and to the point, but also makes a point to show the more complex parts and still maintain clairity.	1
I had purchased my wart stick at a liquidators store so I didn't know what I was really getting. I had a painful wart on the ball of my foot which I had been trying to remove for some time with various methods. I used the stick and the wart was gone in a very short time. I was impressed. It was gone for a year and now it is back and I started using the wart stick again and than misplaced the stick. I just found it in my medicine cabinet. I am bookmarking this item on my computer. I want to know that I can always have this item if I need it. It really works and fast!!!!!!!!!!	1
What an entertaining read...complete fiction I must add but a good book to remind you that there are still narrow minded people in the world who profess to know so much about a religon that they actualyy know very little about. This book makes a great lining for the kittie's litter box...wonderful absorbency!!!	0

"Despite the clever packaging, this CD was NOT produced by the folks behind ""O Brother Where Art Thou?""As it claims, this CD does contain original recordings of many of the songs on the ""O Brother"" soundtrack. If you're looking for the genuine article, this is it.However, as is common with recordings this old, many of the originals were made by semi-professionals with primitive recording technology. As a result, these ""originals"" do not have the clarity, the warmth, or the production values of the masterful performances on ""O Brother"" and the companion live album ""Down from the Mountain."" If you're looking for music that sounds like those two albums, try Gillian Welch's ""Revival"" instead."	0
Or should I have said, should have been better. Clay Aiken was one of the perfomers from AI2 that I fell in love with. What happened to this new CD is anybody's guess. All I know it that this wasn't up to Clay standards and probably should not have been released so quickly. I liked Measure of a Man but that was about it and even it was lacking.	0
Does a great job highly visible. Works well with the different fencers that I use in the different pastures. Last a long time. Can't beat it for the price.	1
This is C-Murders best album, and a classic. With no production credits to beats by the pound, Deadly soundz did great. Althouh Kenoe and his traitor self, did a couple of good songs. I think this album shows good steady down south music. This album proves that he is the best rapper in the no limit camp. It is a great CD.	1

"I often Buy having not seen a movie, especially when the reviews are glowing. Thankfully, I rented this first. I just don't see what was so special about this movie that was not family friendly, boring and drifted. My tastes go more for the movie that i can watch with my large family. This one doesn't qualify.Moreover, I don't see any of the usual devises that make you sit back and say, ""wow, well written"". I only rented this because of the academy award. I don't agree that it should have gotten the award over some of its worthy competitors.Rent it first as I did, maybe you'll agree with the professional reviews."	0
Look at Charles Sharp's review I totally agree with him. Got this book today, nice book but not for the beginner.	1
LOVE IT , LOVE IT, LOVE IT. I exercise to this DVD, 30-35 minutes at a time. The music is great, Tina of course is great. BEST exercise workout I have ever had and the scenery is FINE, FINE, FINE. Thanks to all who make this DVD possible !!!	1

The great god Om chooses to speak to the humans of Discworld about their lack of faith, not through an angel, not in the form of a burning bush but in the form of a turtle, and not a GIANT TURTLE, more like a box turtle. Remember the movie Oh God? Now think about trying to convince the world god speaks through a tiny turtle. Yeah, and it just gets better, Sir Terry's wit will leave you in stitches- or maybe in traction when you throw something out of whack laughing.	1
This dictionary is a great resource. It is full of wonderful color pictures and are very interesting. This book has helped me in many of my classes this semester.	1
This is a book that addresses fundimental issues of what it takes to achieve, what it takes to overcome and how valuable the ethics of hard work and education. Mr. Washington demonstates pragmatism in the universal plight, plus or minus, of arriving in time in our package, whatever it is, and progressing through persistance and acknowledging the heart of his humanity.	1
after the fanstatic acclaimed debut album, garbage had a rough second album to make.well, version 2.0 is the perfect second album. More pop-electronic and yet with the same dark obscure feeling the first album had.shirley's voice is more adaptaded to the songs and they seem to be more a band than they used to. one of garbage's best caracteristics is that all musics are very good. here you can't say that one or two songs are below the average, because they're all excellent. please listen to this album, that confirms that garbage are one of the best (or why not, the best!) band around!	1
The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price.	1
"Maybe this movie is okay for the art-house crowd, or those interested in mental illness, but for me, it was just plain boring. Didn't do a thing for me. Unwatchable. I've seen worse, but wish I'd known what type of ""comedy"" this really was before we paid for the rental.Not recommended."	0
This is a mediocre book at best. The tests give you an illusion that you are a genius too. It is full of self fullfiling falacies. If you think you are a genius, you are... maybe not. Just review your scores on the SAT, GMAT, GRE, or whatever test you have taken. If you did not score in the top percentile, don't call yourself a genius because the tests within these books said so. That is if you don't want to embarass yourself in public, or even in private company.There are far better books out there on how to train and develop your multiple intelligences. This is not the one.Check authors like Michael Gelb, Tony Buzan, Thomas Armstrong, Howard Gardner, and David Coleman. They have developed a ton of serious well researched materials and methods on this subject. They all provide far better stuff than this book.	0
"I was surprised that Oprah picked this book. Perhaps she chose it to challenge her readers, but it is definitely not the spiritually uplifting material that I would associate with Oprah. The book is memorable to me because of its difference in style and because it is depressing. After this one, Oprah's readers will be yearning for something much more ""light"" in both style and heart."	0

I have long wanted to read this book by Nathaniel Hawthorne. It was one of the first books I downloaded when I got my kindle 2. The character portrayals are superb. It analyses the thoughts, motivations, strengths and weaknesses of the four major characters in the story - Hester Prynn, the vengeful doctor, the hapless minister and Hester's vivacious and elf-like daughter Pearl. The description of the little girl and how she copes with being ostracized with her mother by a rigid puritanical society, is especially moving. While there are some descriptions of nature that are quite vivid, most of the text goes into developing these four characters and is a fascinating psychological study, though at times it's little slow.Overall, a well-crafted story and a good read.The book though is hard to navigate on the kindle because it has no active table of contents. I therefore would not purchase this version at regular price. Luckily, it's free!	1
"Wow, after reading all the rave reviews here I expected a great rice cooker. It was anything but...I suppose if I had an hour to wait for my rice it would've proven to be the best rice. 40 minutes plus is the time stated by the directions, I figured cooking one cup would be less, but after 20 minutes the cooker had barely warmed up....I quickly got my ""cheap"" Hamilton cooker ($15) and voila, I had rice a few mintutes later.I'm sure that for those with time or with the time to pre-set cooking time for completion, this is a great machine, but for those that just want to cook some rice quickly and have dinner, don't waste your money. Will be sending this back asap."	0
At 60 pages,this is over-priced and not a course for adults. As basic instruction for those 10 and under, it is probably okay. For anyone who even doodles while talking on the phone- forget it!	0
"And I am a recovering Catholic now Episcopalian! Also,a registered Democrat with moderate to liberal views!Part of the argument we on the religous ""left"" as it were have with those on the far religous ""right"" is that they seem to want everything clearly outlined and defined. Like taking the bible verbatim. With the exception of the ten comandments when was anything said in the Bible or by Jesus as clear as a bell??????That is we, on the left think the Bible was divine inspiration not divine dictation. There is just no way the Mother of God would clearly say all the things the 3rd secret is suppose to reveal and so clearly in the syntax of the day now in the 21st century!!!!!It was an interesting point that the author had Clement be a pope of German birth and the book was probably started long before Benedict's election. The stuff on St. malachy's predictions was interesting too althought probably a fraud."	0

"When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say ""What on earth is this?..."" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing."	0
This book is so good. Fast dialogue, adventurous, romantic and full of heroic characters. You laugh, you hold your breath you cheer. I have read this book no less than 5 times.

The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in.......	0
It only took me about 15 minutes. These Transformers movies keep getting more expensive and equally more ridiculous. The first one was charming and really funny, especially the first half. The humor reminded me of Armageddon. I actually liked Shia LaBeouf back then. This one tries way too hard in every aspect and fails in almost all of them. I understand these movies are not to be taken too seriously (I mean this is one step up from Power Rangers), but this movie could've been presented much better.The only reason I'm not giving one star is because the special effects and action sequences were exciting at times.	0
It's simple. If I don't get to choose the color I want, I don't buy it. Is this company run by idiots??	0
"These short curves are really a nice addition to your wooden railway system as they make it possible to create small and sharper turns than you can do with the normal curved track (33342). The downside of this track is that it may be a bit difficult for longer engines (like the mighty red battery-powered engine) to drive through the curves. However, if the tracks are laid without too many ""bumps"" at the connecting points the larger engines will manage to drive through it as well."	1

I have an older Craftsman Garage Door Opener. Had replaced the gears to my garage door opener and it would not work right. Would only move a foot or so and stop. Looked up information about what could possibly be wrong and it suggested that the RPM Sensor Assembly probably needed replaced. Replaced it and it now works like a charm. Was much cheaper then buying a whole new automatic garage door opener.	1
I thought this was a kit for 1 door, which would mean 2 pins and bushings.I feel it was misleading, as you actually need to buy 2 of this kit to fix one door.Which means this is not the cheapest one on the market.The sale on the other hand was smooth, no complaint.	0
Lightweight horror yarn that is more fluff than substance. Keanu Reeves was not the right man to pull this role off and the decision to cast him was huge disservice to the entire movie because he just does not cut it in the role. He makes an effort but he just not a strong enough actor to pull of the role and the script he's working with does not cut it as well because its badly written in certain scenes and does not hold itself well once you look closely at it. The visual effects are below par with some of the movie that has come out recently and the musical score is not well done. Rachel Weisz does in fact give the best performance out of the entire film and that's manly because she gives more to her role than the story itself does and a special nod also goes to Peter Stormare who's only in the last few minutes of the film but manages to give a good performance with the little he has.	0
I bought 6 of these shirts going by the photographs and some of the reviews. Dont mean to be rude, but people who gave these shirts probably haven't wore a decent dress shirt. You can frequently get 'good' $45 shirt for $10 in malls when on sale. I thought this was a better deal. But boy oh boy, I can assure you this is not much better than what you might get at a dollar store. I had ordered these as a gift, but now will give them to Red Cross because these should not be worn at any kind of formal occassion, or even for daily use (except maybe when you are working at Septic tanks or something). These are from Bangladesh, and I can assure you, they are not much better than what would be sold for $0.50 in BGD. If you have any self-respect and work in anything but a lowest income group atmosphere, DO NOT BUY THESE SHIRTS.	0
I used these once then used a Kleenex to wipe one lens that was a little smudged. I have microscopic vision and I noticed it was scratched AFTER I used the Kleenex, so to be sure, I used it again and sure enough, it scratched the lens some more. I compared the 2 lenses and the other lens looked pristine, whereas the one I used the kleenex on was scratched all over! Very low quality lenses! Unusable after one use!	0
We chose this printer because of the network capability. The first printer stopped functioning correctly after three weeks. To print, we had to turn the printer off, then back on, and then print. We had to do this every time we wanted to print. HP sent us a replacement printer, and it worked correctly for 4 days. After over an hour on the phone with HP, I was told the printer is not very stable in a network application, and we should use the printer via a USB connection. If HP knows the unit is not stable in a network environment, then HP should correct the problem, or stop selling the unit.	0
Yes. Yes. I know. This was not the book. You are right, it was not. Not even close. Just think of it as a different author telling a different story, in a different format, using familiar characters.The story and adventure were good.The action was exciting.The production was good.For a family film, it is worth keeping around.	1
This game is Ok. If you like slow paced games this is your game.The graphics are great but the gameplay is slow.You can play all of the fellowship but you have to get to Rivendel to get Gimli,Legolas,Borimer,and Gandalf.	0
These things are just about impossible to use. They are so difficult to stretch over any size bowls. I sat around the table with four family members (including one strong man) trying to fit these over various bowls...all we accomplished was flipping these things across the room! I originally purchased them for an elderly relative, but she couldn't use them due to her arthritic hands, but I soon found out that arthritis or no arthritis...these things are too difficult to stretch over bowls! Save your money and use some cling wrap.	0
We have always used Pampers Swaddlers and loved them, but they only go up to size 3. Now that my daughter is 14 months old, we needed to move her to size 4. I ordered an economy pack of Pampers Baby Dry diapers and she has a terrible rash. I don't think she has particularly sensitive skin, either. We've tried Pampers Cruisers before and will definitely be moving back to those. Although, I don't like this particular product of Pampers, it's the only brand that doesn't leak for us!	0

The hand held electronic 20 Questions game is one of the most entertaining little gadgets I have ever seen. It's fun to play by yourself or with a group of people, and because of it's size, you can take it virtually anywhere.

This was a great book that brings the Bible and it's characters to life. If you want to gain a deeper knowledge of King Hezekiah and his life, you must read this book. The scriptures inspire, the story brings courage and hope of God's love, forgiveness, and restoration that He is true to his Word.	1
I have adored Dean Konntz since I was in High school, I remember reading Phantoms for the first time and not sleeping through a night for a week! He is simply the best author I've ever found, he grabs you in the first page and doesn't let go until he's done what he wants to.I too was very Wary of the title, but I've found I'm not thinking about Frankenstein when I'm reading this, I'm just too engrossed in the characters! I can not wait until book two and I am so glad he wrote this instead of following through with making it a movie as he mentions in the begining of the book.	1
'Fantastic, Emotional, and Genuinely Gripping' says Mick LaSalle of San Francisco Chronicle. I would add 'Addictive and Philosophical'. This film is ultimately about struggle between means to fight injustice, and their own philosophies, which, I think, is portrayed handsomely, but little artificially.	1
"Okay,first off I would like to say that I enjoy almost any book I read. This book has made it to the top of my ""burn this book"" list. Dont get me wrong, the idea was well thought up, but the book wasn't well written. First off, the book starts off with someone trying to commit suicide,and this character is saved even though she's totally wack. Second, the main character is named ""GUY MONTAG"". How origanal. Third, the people in this book are IDIOTS! I mean, first they outlaw all ""offensive"" material, then they condense great novels into two page stories,and then they sit around on thier butt all day watching the ""family"" argue and OFFEND each other. The best character in the book simply dissappears in the middle of the book, and then she is found dead. Not only that but no one has friends. Not even your spouse is your friend. What kind of wack society doesn't have friends. This book needs to be re-written, and seriously re-done"	0
This book is a rarity in UFO literature, primarily b/c most UFO books present their information in dates and names and places and events ... in a sense, completely without any feeling or substance beyond the 'happening.' The shocker of the ending of THE MOTHMAN PROPHECIES you already know if you read the 1st chapter, but, as you've been drawn further and further into the lives of the main participants, the ending hits you like a sledgehammer b/c you've spent the last 250 pages forgetting all about it. More UFO books should be written with this humanistic approach; perhaps then the subject wouldn't be so taboo.	1
I purchased these for work and they lasted FOREVER! i basically wore them every day. I did finally have to throw them out because they got woren out and my feet started to get cold on the bottom from living in Minnesota, haha. But i would def buy these again!!!!!	1

"Yes, this book is brain candy. Potato chips for the mind. So what? Not every book has to be freakin' ""War and Peace"". Mr. Ringo gives us the ultimate adolescent fantasy -- a super-warrior with a harem, his own band of warriors, all the weapons & gadgets he wants, Presidential support, his own brewery, and millions of dollars. (Having read what I just wrote, I feel a strong urge to shout, ""Dude! Chicks and money and guns! And beer!Awesome!"" I'll try to restrain myself. Heh.)While the sex scenes are a bit overdone, the novel itself is quite enjoyable. I read it while stuck in an 8-hour plane ride; and I must say it was very entertaining. If you want a fast-paced, action-filled story that'll keep your interest, this book is for you."	1
I bought this because I thought it would keep me entertained at work. It did- for about 5 minutes. The games are VERY easy, I beat them quickly, but you can only play three times a day then you can't collect any more NPs, so there's no point. And you can't manipulate the clock to make the game think it's the next day. I'm just going to keep playing until I can get my rare item code, but I was very disappointed in the game, I thought Neopets could do better.	0
What a great item for any Stooges fan. This was a gift and the recipient loved it. The lunchbox is a def. collectable although it arrived slightly scratched. The Laurel and Hardy video is like an extra bonus as most stooge fans also love L&H. And I know the whoopy cushion will be a joy once our son finds it LOL.	1
Christopher Walken is scarier than the aliens, but the film manages to stir up some creepy paranoia at times. The scenes aboard the spaceship (or whatever it was) were a little weak, but in the cabin and in that long spooky school hallway were well done.	1
I was excited about this dvd given the quality of other Nova productions but that faded fast once I started watching it. The dvd spends most of the hour on a native Indian and how he uses the art of sand painting to express his view of the world. This was not what I expected. There were parts however, that did get into how the eye works and how there are 4 sections of the brain used for seeing (the 4 parts are form, shape, color, and movement) and somehow the brain presents us with a unified experience of all these processes. Also, how the same neuro-pathways we use for imagining an object and actually seeing it are the same. I really enjoyed those parts yet so much time was spent on the subjective evaluations of how this Indian sees the world that I considered it a waste of time. The ratio was about 20 minutes on vision / brain activity and 40 minutes on this Indian's view of the world. Very disappointing indeed.	0
This is a great puzzle to have in a childcare center , the children love working with the different numbers	1
the book had a great story behind it and it was told well for the most part. The only thing i could say that was negative about it was some parts were slow. It was mostly a book for the twelve and older range, but for the most part,it was entertaining.	1
I am going to have to disagree with most of the other reviews posted here. This is not the best that Stereolab has to offer. The first Stereolab records I heard were Dots & Loops and Cobra and Phase... I was absolutely blown away by those albums. I just couldn't get that excited about this one though. The songs are just kind of lifeless; they have some interested ideas, but never really get anywhere with them. It has the same Stereolab sound without any bounce or interplay between the instruments. I would recommend Dots & Loops over this one 7 days a week and twice on Sunday	0

Threw this book right in the trash not even a chapter into it, because I realized it is nothing but the same old recycled and obsolete right-wing drivel that we've been peppered with over and over, and that took our country to the edge of a second Great Depression. If you are a concerned American you should stay away from this book!	0
I am a big fan of pop music among other genres but this album lacks a personality. Sort of like being stuck in a time warp and transported back to the late 90s. The songs just seem to blend together. It also appears as if Mr. Aiken is not too invested in his on product, he seems very detached from the songs.I also found the album overproduced.

It is too thick for me and the material is very hard too uncomfortable I would not recommend it because it did not explained how the product really was and even though is brand new in the box never been used you can not return the product . So I just wasted my money...	0
"this has got to be the greatest book i have ever read.it kept me in suspence to the very last.it can be taken on so many levels. the best thing about it is the ending, where unlike day of the triffids or any other contemperies,there is not one glimpse of hope which is better than ""they live happily ever after"" BIG BROTHER IS WATCHING!!!!!"	1
Not Hilton's best, but still somehow a gem.An aimless Englishman poses as a peasant in Revolutionary Russia, & subsequently tries to wander his way back to Western Europe, discovering on the way something more important: a reason to live--but too late?Despite these problems:1) the plot, as the travelers, wander terribly,2) the supporting characters are usually either stock or flat,3) the 'suspense' usually fails, as event turns are often predictable,4) slow start; unsatisfying ending.the story still somehow works, and works well!I just don't get it. Hilton violates cardinal rules of a good novel and still somehow turns out a work that wrenches my frozen heart.Must be something in the manner of the telling.If you like this story, you'll love Hilton'sRandom Harvest, or his more famousLost Horizon: A Novel(BTW, in both cases, avoid the movies --terrible, terrible flops!)	1

Firstly, I find it startling that Vintage would deign to publish something so poorly written. The semi-literacy of this prose (I'm being generous) does, if nothing else, suggest that Miss Souljah didn't use a ghost writer. The words, in all their ghettofied glory, are hers. Booker T. Washington would have wept. While I can appreciate to some extent this woman's pathological disgust of whites, I cannot understand the roots of her homophobia or anti-Semitism. Her easy-way-out philosophy (Everybody's to Blame Except Me) is the very thing that keeps her where she is.	0
I bought this for my 13-year-old stepson thinking it would be a cool toy. It turned out to just be annoying and he got bored with it in a day. It was way too expensive for what it really is, an annoying noise machine.	0
"I bought this set thinking I was going to enjoy many hours of The Stooges. It only has a few shorts that are all over-played on TV, having seen them a hundred times already.Charging a full retail price for a set like this, containing just a few shorts, is shameful. You're paying an extra 10 bucks for the tin box, little more. This set is a bargain-bin type item worth maybe four to five bucks at most.It's my fault for being suckered out of my money. This purchase has taught me to read the content descriptions VERY CAREFULLY before buying future ""special collections.""Now I'm off to buy the REAL complete chronological collections of The Three Stooges being released by Sony Pictures."	0
"this is a really pretty ring, but, since it is ""rolling"" type ring, the gems fall out quite easily. Also, there are two gold bands, and one silver band, instead of three different colored bands (gold, rose and silver, etc), which would have made more sense. The two gold, one silver just looks odd. I got a lot of compliments the first few days I had the ring, but after that the gems fell out, so, I don't wear it at all."	0
"I just gave this to my 3 year old for her birthday tonight. She was so excited about her ""baby alligator"" but when I tried to show her that it was a game, I couldn't make it work. I tried 6 times and ONE of the times I pushed all the teeth in and got it to snap closed. DO NOT BUY THIS!"	0
I didn't buy the printer from Amazon. But because I like Amazon and value its readers is my reason for writing this. The HP Photosmart 2575xi that I purchased was a great machine. However, when you discover its little idiosyncrasies it becomes a royal pain in the neck! The paper feed does not work correctly and I am not the only one that has had this problem. It completely destroyed my faith in HP when techs tell you turn it off 3 times and then what? Send it back...............You have to hand feed like a little baby.........then the paper jam error comes up................wonder what HP Tech's go to school for.......to learn to say turn it off 3 times and unplug it for 10 minutes..........then repeat it...sounds like level I techs on the Internet Providers..........Get your act together HP.....................	0
This is, by far, the most bug filled game I have ever played. The new control system is extremely clumsy and will leave Lara die-hards wondering what the developers were thinking when they decided to revamp the old one. I hate to say it, but I think EIDOS was more concerned about not missing another promised release date and sent out an unfinished product; the obvious quality issues are apparent in the first chapter and get progressively worse. I would not be surprised if the company has to issue a recall for this defective product. On a positve note, the improved graphics are beautiful, but are hard to appreciate because of the frustrating gameplay.	0
Jason's graphic novels are great. They flumox many people but I love them andfind them quite real in expressing human emotion. Great graphics.	1

"The slow-paced ""At War with the Army"" (1950) was Dean Martin and Jerry Lewis' first starring feature - a bargain-basement military farce that separates the team for much of its footage. Some nice moments (the ""Going My Way"" parody remains priceless), but not enough to justify the endless 93-minute length. One of the comedy duo's weakest efforts."	0

Jennifer Love Hewitt shines as actess and humanitarian Audrey Hepburn. The flashback techniques is really quite empresive, and Hewitt brings charm, grace, and real drama to this part. It shows all important moments in the actress' life and tells you more about the actress.	1

This card worked great in my Canon G3 digital camera for few months, and the 'CF Card Error' started happending (as some of the other reviewers have also experienced). I reformatted the disk few times and I'm still getting that error when I turn on my camera. Since it has a life time warranty on it, I'm RMA it back to SimpleTech.	0
The three generations of women in this book are full of gumption and spunk. She really wove them together well. You find yourself relating to the characters. I wish I knew Charlie Kate. She's some woman. I find this book just as good as Ellen Foster although the writing style is slightly different.	1
"Have you ever watched a movie and at the end of it you literally say out loud, ""Wow, there goes 2 hours of my life that I'll never get back."" Well that pretty much sums up Last Days. This movie was beyond boring and completely with out plot. I mean, my God, we spend the first five minutes watching the whacked out druggy swim, stare at fire, and hum the theme to Bonanza. Need I say more? The one redeeming quality this movie did posses however was the music. The scene shot from a far looking in the window in on Blake was attention grabbing but that really only lasted for about 3 minutes. Save yourself the time and watch something else."	0
This is another well written piece by Don Miguel Ruiz to augment his book The Four Agreements. As a companion book, it clarifies & expands on the ideas in it's book of origin. The spiritual exploration is straight forward yet spiritually mindful.JLB	1
My 18 month old received this as a gift for his 1st birthday. I agree that the buttons are too hard to push, they work great if he steps on them. It is indestractable, believe me he has thrown it, sat on it and stepped on it. Problem is, he could care less. We tried playing with him, naming the colors and shapes. One shot through the line-up and he was off looking for something else to do. In my opinion, it's just not interesting enough.	0
This is a very good rack once you get it set up. It takes a good 30-45 minutes to set up this rack initially. Once you've done it the first time, subsequent installation will only take 5-10 minutes. This rack doesn't come with anything, all accessories have to be purchased separately; for such an expensive rack, I thought it would have been nice for them to include some extra Velcro straps to tie down your fork or something.The rack itself is very sturdy and I feel my bike is always secured. The rubber feet left no marks on my trunk lid or bumper. I only wish there was a way to lock the bike and rack together.	1
"""The Big Night,"" is a breakthrough album for David Zollo. After a Tenure in Iowa's ""High and Lonesome,"" and a collection of solo albums each building upon the last, this album presents itself as the matured Zollo in good form. The music is the sound of Iowa, with its dirt roads and endless fields of corn. This is the sound of honky tonk Barn parties sung by a throat as scratchy as brillo pad. Check it out."	1
very nice car bed my son is 3 years old and he really likes his new car bed and it was pretty easy to put together i highly recommend this car bed to all the people out there looking for a car bed	1
Weak story, Characters were not interesting or engaging and Vampire rules were silly. Also tired of the Gay=slutty and incapable of an adult relationship. Can't we do better?	0
I recommend this to everyone of all ages and reading levels. I fell in love with this book after the first page. I was amazed with Wagner's writing style. His poetic descriptions make the characters and the world he writes them into come alive. After reading this book I immediately went back to the beginning and started reading it all over again. This is one of those special books I will read and recommend to everyone again and again.	1
This is a great cd. It takes a few times listening to it to start enjoying it,then it sounds like a new,but familiar lagwagon. This one was dedicated to Derrick Plourde, their original drummer that played the blistering drums on duh,trashed, and hoss. He committed suicide in 2005. This album is very well written,even though it only took them 2 weeks to write the songs. This album is definately up there in their top 5 albums.	1
This movie was funny! I love Hockey, and I love this movie. If you love Hockey, then you'll love this movie!	1

This movie is perfect for bringing the real spirit of Christmas in your home. Great music, fun retelling of the Nativity story.	1
"Defintley Maybe is not like any rock album I've ever heard. Liam's vocals are the kind that linger in your head for a long time. ""Rock N' Roll Star"" and ""Married With Children"" are the best songs on it if you ask me. ""Supersonic"" is also a good song. Defintley maybe sounds like someone took the talent of Jimmy Page, Elton John, The Beatles, mixed it all together in a big pot, then molded it into a CD. Yes, this CD is THAT good."	1
The movie was awful. Not only did the plot not make any sense, the audience really does not sympathize with either of the two main characters. It also was violent for violent's sake. It was all shot in a very unlovable and gritty lighting. The CGIs were unrealistic and distracting.I didn't like the main female character's husky voice. She delivered a poor acting performance. As for the angel, why? why? why? Why the ridiculously cut hair? The characters seemed to be thrown in, all with their slightly different accents or speaking styles. It's a big mess, all glued together at the end, without having thought everything through.Oh, and the cab driver boy was annoying.Ugh! what a junk of a movie. How can rate this less than one star?	0
It was funny, bad acting, stupid scripts and over the top special effects! There was nothing else to do but to laugh at how stupid it was. This movie good be 1 hour shorter if it wasn't for all the repeated scences of just looking at the house from the outside. And no, Catherine Zeta Jones didn't save the movie.	0
This book was great.It was scary at some points, but other times it was a little dull.They also had a wide variety of stories like the first one.They also had many new topics.If you thought the first one had scary stories ,then you should read this one.	1
This is a must read for anyone who cares about the direction our world is heading...For anyone who truly wants to choose world peace...For anyone who has tried to change their own life without success, and wants to know how to choose something different...For anyone who has ever prayed and wondered why the object of their prayer was not forthcoming. It is well written and reads easily, aided by personal anecdotes. It is also well referenced and gives us practical direction based on truths that have been known since ancient times. The prophesies seem to say we are heading for destruction, and we may be....but we have the collective ability to choose that path or not. But we must choose, and Gregg shows us how...how to choose our collective future and our personal one. Bravo Gregg - Well done.	1
I read this book for school, my sister said it would get better, but it turned out to be the worst book I've ever read. I rest my case.	0
All in all, I like these diapers. My daughter wore the size 4 Baby Dry diapers and I decided to switch to the bigger ones. My daughter's weight is 26 lbs and the size 4 was just too small for her. As she started gaining more weight she began growing out of these diapers because later on she started having leaks from the diaper at night. I decided to go with the bigger size 5 and that it should be better. Well they are great because they are bigger, but the problem is that they are too big. There's space between her body and the middle of the diaper. So when she pees, at times the pee just comes out on the side instead of the diaper. The connection between the body and diaper is not good. I'm sure when she gains more weight the diapers will be great again. Overall I like these diapers a lot.	1
I saw a commercial for this movie. The special effects looked great. I was expecting to see a great action-packed movie. A friend and I anxiously stepped into the theater. The movie started with a little action, but then it was gone. Nothing. That was it. I actually fell asleep during it, something I never did before! This was one of the STUPIDEST movies I have ever seen in my life. It doesn't even deserve one star, but I've got to give it something. If you think that this looks like a good deal, think again. Your money is worth something much better for the same price.	0
No, it's not as good as the original. But let's rate it on it's own merit - hmmm, it has none! This movie sucks whether you compare it to the original or let it try and stand alone! One of the worst movies of recent years, it has ridiculous acting (except for Liam Neeson, but it's not like he's good, I don't know why he did this) and one of the stupidest plots I have ever seen in my life. This is such a waste, don't buy it, don't rent it. This is a terrible movie. Period.	0
I think this book is a requrement for anyone that is in the ministry. I found a lot of nuggets embeded in the book. Principles that the author provide for the reader are applicable to life and other disciplines. If you are seeking to enrich your theology education, I highly recommend this book. Written hundreds of years ago, Spurgeon's ideas and concepts transcends time. This book will be a part of my library for years to come. In fact, I purchased a copy for my brother since he is in the ministry.	1
I bought this, the Le Creuset enameled crepe pan, and a crepe recipe book for my husband for Christmas (he's crazy for crepes). At first the spatuala looked too big for the 8 in pan but it actually worked like a charm. This was our first time making crepes and it takes a little practice but was great fun and the spatula is a big help. It is somewhat pourus wood so will darken a bit from the oil/butter in the crepe pan, but it doesn't detract.	1
I don't get this toy, it seems to suck it. I also don't understand the whole fart or burping that everyone else has experienced. I've never heard it do that. My parents got this for my 3 year old. A little young if you ask me. I personally don't get it. What's the point? I mean I can listen to the radio to hear music. I just don't get it and the eyes moving do take away from the actual playing of music, they are loud. I think this toy is just a waste of money, but my parents can afford it so I'll keep it until I get annoyed and throw it out.	0
First of all, Peyton was my favorite character. Second of all, Haley, Mouth and Millie are unlikable characters, in my opinions. Does anyone care about Skills and his girlfriend Lauren, or Mouth and his job? And YET again, Nathan and Haley's marriage is on shaky ground. Everything seems recycled. Fortunately, Clay is the beacon of the light. A likable guy who seemed unable to commit, he found his love in Quinn. Yet again Schwahn decides to kill someone off, this being Haley and Quinn's mother. Yet again, Schwahn uses the plot line of a crazy stalker. Unfortunately, the character of Dan is not in much of the season. Attempts to be funny were made, such as the girls getting high of pot brownies. Attempts failed. Terrible season. The only reason I will watch season 8 is because of Clay, and because I've been watching since the beginning. The show should have ended after season 6.	0
"...that buckles every swash imaginable. War, treachery, disguise, secret passages, shipwrecks, damsels in distress -- an amazing amount gets packed into this not-very-long book. Great fun, but the pseudo-fifteenth-century dialog (""Sirs, this knave arrow likes me not. But it importeth rather to take counsel."") will prove an unfortunate obstacle to the very readers who would otherwise enjoy the story most, the young."	1
I bought this Hoya 55mm Circ Polarizer filter for my Sony SLT A 55 and I must say that I have liked the results that this filter has produced. I am not a very pro photographer but like to add filters sometimes and this serves my purpose. I would recommend this if you dont want to spend a lot of money yet want a very good filter.	1
The Jabra Eargels are wonderful.. I cannot believe how comfortable, and user friendly they are. Thank you, if not for these, I could not use my bluetooth.Great Merchandise..	1
I watched this movie when it first came out and thought it was really boring and disappointing. I generally like Katie Holmes and think she was fine in the movie, but Christian Bale was lousy and so was the plot and direction of this movie. If you just want to see a series of technical movie stunts followed by a few mildly romantic scenes surrounding a plethora of neurotic, self-absorbed dialogue, psychosis, and horrible directing, then you might be interested in watching this movie.	0
Great historical reference text full of recipes for food (some of which we would now consider very odd), ways to clean things, sermons on morality, and other tidbits by a woman who was very progressive in her era.	1
"Not at all even handed. Morris makes sweeping statements about what an entire group of people were thinking or feeling based on antidotal evidence at best. Anyone looking to this book to educate themselves about the history of the region should also know that the author has since recanted much of the editorializing he did in these pages. Besides being misleading, it's dense, boring and long. I recommend it only in lieu of a sleeping pill. Look for my copy on the ""used books"" shelf."	0
This non-oily serum is a delight. Just a dab works for the whole face. Super-rich in emollients, it is ideal for aging skin. This item is a bit pricey, but so worth it. I originally was sold on this product at Ulta Beauty Supply and the price was about 10% higher there than through Amazon, which I found to be the cheapest anywhere. The entire Exuviance line is quite wonderful. I am 63 and live in the high altitude and very dry Sierra Nevada Mountains and this product keeps my skin moisturized without being oily or greasy and looking young and vital.	1
I have had this cookbook for a couple of years without really using it. But a few months ago, I pulled it back of the shelf and never put it back on that shelf since. I never considered myself a good cook. In fact I am just the opposite, the typical single guy who used to eat out all of the time. This book has definately changed that. The recipes are very easy. And the dinners that I have made do not taste anything like diet meals. I recommend this cookbook for everyone - dieters as well as non-dieters. I am also not the type to write book reviews (this is the first and probably the only) except that I think so highly of this cookbook that I wanted to recommend it to others.	0

I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!	1
The entire DVD seems to be more instructional than anything else. There isn't much of a workout at all. In between some of the movements there is a splash on the screen while a huge amount of rest time goes by and this is where you are told how to workout using what has been demonstrated. And by told it says that if you are a beginner you do this many sets and if you are intermediate you do this many and if you are advanced you do this many but that is it. There isn't much to follow after that. Even the warm-up in the cardio section leaves you cold.All in all I am still in search of a basic kettlebell workout that requires a little bit of effort. I was hoping this was it.	0
Don't use this crap in a newer engine. My 03 Nissan has been going through oil. I put this into my car and within 5 miles, failure. Car stalled and would barely run. Had to have the oil & filter changed including diagnostic time $85 shot.	0

Jim the Boy is perhaps the worst book I have ever read, excepting The Man in the High Castle. When I unfortunately and forcedly (I had to read it for school) partook in reading this horrible novel, I was at first puzzled. Is this supposed to be making fun of bad books?...Jim the Boy portrays the depression-era South in an idealistic manner: the protagonist (or antagonist) Jim faces little hardship at all. There is even less action, and even less plot than the vicissitudes that Jim endures...	0
I first heard Sue Bender on NPR talking about her Amish experience...I was enthralled with it. Later I found the book and read it start to finish in one sitting. As I read it I kept thinking I wanted to buy a copy for all my friends.	1
When I ordered this book, I expected a book which would be overly simple in explanations and not very much depth. I was pleasantly surprised by its content. The book is very easy to understand and very readable. Some of the subjects I found a little boring, but that is to be expected in most books. Overall I thought this book captured my attention and helped me look at certain aspects of mathematics in a new manner. I enjoyed most chapters , but especially the topic of topology. Very easy to understand the basics thanks to explanations. I wholeheartedly encourage reading this book.	1
Lets face it. The music industry would have NEVER discovered this young man. Gangly, southern, loves his mother... But he truly IS a pop star. This album proves it. The songs sound a tad bit over-produced and there really isn't an original 'feel' to this CD, but for some reason, my wife and I can't seem to get enough of it. We think because the CD underscores and carries the sincerity that shone through during his metamorphosis on American Idol. He's the long-shot that won (albeit second, he far outshines the rest). And this album is a winner of sorts. We'll buy his next one so we can continue to enjoy watching him grow and change as an artist. Just like he did on TV.	1
This is the kind of film I get stuck watching on long plane rides and would NEVER seek myself. It is such silly schlock that I marvel at how the Hollywood mill can churn these things out and make money - it's really an industrial production process, geared to superficial viewers.This is one of the basic plots. THe others include crippled boy, whose love of a dog or pony allows him to walk, love, or talk. Why do we keep watching this junk? A video game at least offers some chance of a variation in outcome.OK, here goes: beautiful girl with a dream, seeking big break, gets gig in a bar, handles it, meets boy who doesn't fit into plans, shakes it, shakes it more, shakes it a lot more, flirts with corruption, stays course, makes real friends, gets to know real self, grows. Oh, and then succeeds on her own terms.Not recommended. Admittedly, the acting in not abysmal, but what a waste of time about lives that could never exist.	0
I read A Tree Grows in Brooklyn by Betty Smith as a teenager many years ago. I went on to read her other novels as well. I got the audiobook for my husband and I to listen to on a trip. I still love it. I think I missed some of the underlying messages when I read it when I was young, and I don't think I really agree with Ms. Smith's world view, her political and theological ideology. But I love her rather poetic writing style, and the way the characters are so REAL! The reader on this audio version is excellent as well. Everyone should read this book!	1
Bought this as one of the toys for my 4 year old's birthday. The mouth does not shut even with all the teeth pressed down. Very frustrating for him as he doesn't see any point to the game. We've tried it several times but no luck. And sometimes not all the teeth stay down so we're not sure if they're supposed to stay down or rebound back up. The spring inside makes a weird clicking sound so I'd assume it's broken. I wish I had taken the negative reviews seriously. Sometimes I luck out with a product even with bad reviews but not this time. It really does not work. Quite disappointing. Make sure it's not the 'only' gift so they can get distracted with the others that actually do work.	0
"B McKnight is still the man. I've been listening to his stuff for years and I keep waiting for him to have the ""one"" album that's just ghetto. I'm still waiting. His vocals are literally flawless. My favorite track is ""What We Do Here"" and ""Stay."" Definitely worth the cost and then some... if you're looking for some smooth groove for your groove."	1
"I must echo some sentiments in saying that Ian McKellen was robbed of the Oscar by a hyperactive goof. He broke my heart in his portrayal of James Whale, and not in an emotionally manipulative way. Brendan Fraser was incredible as always, and Lynn Redgrave cracked me up. This movie was ingenious, and if you liked it, definitely read ""Father of Frankenstein."""	1
"I have learned Java from ""Core Java"". It was a wonderful book. I just picked up this one and before I even finished the first chapter I was so sick and full with all propaganda the author tries to make me believe. He should know to treat us professional developers better than this. I rate it 2-star instead of 1 even before I read the book because I want to be fair with him. When I finally get back to my sense and sit down to read this book I may think it deserve a better rating or maybe worse. Who know?"	0
I have found that you can't beat Amazons Pampers prices and the best thing is that they show up on my door step often in less than a week!!!!!!!! No tax and no shipping.I buy all of my diapers from Amazon. The only down side is that I haven't figured out if or how to use manufactures coupons on Amazon's site for even greater savings but the deals are as good as it gets.	1
"This was actually better than what most will tell you. And considering the time frame for they're favorite group this has to be considered this group's Masterpiece.Simply put some of us were not waiting for Morning Glory 2. And the imagination put forth on this is simply stunning. ""Magic Pie"" is unmatched for sound and beauty and I can't think of another one of they're CD's that makes me return over and over again.No this is not what may be considered what made them ""Fimiliar to Millions"". This, and I dread this word is ""Art"". Check it."	1
This book contains supreme beauty and the worst ugliness. One of the greatest works of the 20th century, one all should have a go at.	1
This album is wonderful. I can listen to it for hours, and I'm 65 years old. Please be cautious in believing critical reviews, as some people are unhappy that Clay's album came out before Ruben's. I'm sure Ruben's album will be really great also.	1
I am deeply disappointed and thoroughly frustrated with the perplexing and redundant complications of the book. It is true that the author, apart form being a very fertile textbook writer, has a very thorough approach when it comes to derivations and mathematical explanations. However, in doing this, he obscures the physics contained. The author insists on very thorough mathematical explanation without reference to intuition, making the topic more about mathematical derivations then physics. The mathematics is not complicated, it is just tedious. He does not leave anything to be done by the reader, turning the learning process into an effort of understanding how the author thinks and how he thinks you should understand the topic.	0
If you are one of the 7 people who understand FW, please let me know.For years, I have asked: what is so great about Finnegans Wake. Even the experts have given me only fragments of answers.The truth is that Finnegans Wake is written by a genius for an audience of around 20 people.I always thought it was odd that James Joyce had to invent words. The English language is rich enough that he should not have found the need to invent gibberish.If you can honesty tell me what is so great about this book, I will change my rating of it. Until then, it gets one star, only because there is no zero star rating.	0
Glenn Jones has one of the most fabulous voices of all time. He's right there with Luther, Marvin and the rest. Unfortunately he gets ignored for much less talented singers. If you'd just like to hear a fantastic voice sing fantastic songs, buy this. You definitely won't be disappointed.	1
I have three of these mattresses. They are much longer lasting and more sturdy than other brands I have purchased. They are very comfortable.I highly recommend this product.	1
WOW!! This cd is outstanding from start to finish! Every song is great! I can't even pick one song that i really don't care for. Good job Clay....your first cd is worth 5 STARS. Buy this today!	1
I bought this over the lower priced version, based on reviews of people who were very happy with it. I was disappointed from day 1. It actually arrived in the mail and looked as though it was a return from someone else, as the plastic was lightly scratched on the surface.I turned it on and used it with a cup of fresh HOT coffee and it only stayed at a WARM temperature. This only kept my coffee slightly warm, right about the temperature you would go refill your coffee because it's getting cold.I will be returning this product.	0
Always nervous about purchasing a VHS tape ...but wanted to see this version of the movie and it was the only format in which I found this version available. In exactly the condition as advertised. Played perfectly.	1
The book was pretty well written, but is typical in that the conservatives are the evil ones and the liberals are the good guys. How tiresome that plotline is!! But the unforgivable sin is the third secret. It is just plain stupid. Any one who knows anything about Catholicism will just laugh off the third secret. It is just wishful thinking by people who want their Catholicism in the cafeteria style. I stopped reading it after that.	0

The book was good. Kept my interest. In no way am I finished reading it. It isn't a book to read from front to back. The information on each herb is detailed. Great reference material. It was a good addition.	1
I can't believe this Great Film Has not been giventhe widescreen treatment it ,and we, deserve.Some extraswould be nice too.	0
I read this book 24 years ago, after having just gotten out of an abusive relationship. Reading it helped me tremendously in understanding what my ex was doing. That's what I remember about this book. So, now reading the reviews, that all mention the book being about valium addiction, I'm kind of surprised that I only remember the parts that resonated with my own life at the time. To me this book was extremely powerful and I've recommended it to other strong women that have been in emotionally abusive relationship. So, I think I will have to reread the book to see, if the abuse was really only such a small part of the book and not really what it is about.	1
Charles Manson is part of the American conscience, so I was of course aware of who he was when I began the story. My mom had told me that it was so scary when she tried to read it in college that she ran down the hall and threw the book in the bathroom trash! So I wasn't exactly sure what to expect.Bugliosi is a very good writer and exceptionally detail-oriented. The story begins with a bit of background on Sharon Tate and Roman Polanski and introducing the reader to the other people that were killed in the house that night. He also briefly covers the LaBiancas, the lesser known victims of that murderous spree. Once the crimes are committed, the story becomes more and more fascinating as the key players and their motives are introduced. It all seemed senseless before and it still seems senseless after reading Bugliosi's exhaustive account. Any true crime fan should definitely give this a read, the ultimate in true crime writing.	1
Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice.	1
Can not get the pictures off the camera. Keeps saying faliure when try to download or go to website.	0
"My wife and I bought this rice cooker a little over a month ago, and we've used it at least twice a week since. It has performed flawlessly every time, with all sorts of rice. Cleanup is very easy with the non-stick bowl, and the programmable timer means that we can start dinner before we leave for work in the morning.We're both very happy with what we call ""the Neuro Fuzzy"", and would whole-heartedly recommend it."	1
I purchased this for my 11 year old son for Christmas. He has the first movie and has watched it numerous times. After we watched this movie I asked how he liked it. His response was same as mine. We give this a D rating, at best, a C. I have a feeling he won't be watching this over and over again.	0
I just could not read it; it was too violent and ugly. Perhaps it was just me but I couldn't get past the first chapter.	0
My friend just brought a Epson c820 and it print better photosthan my HP 1115. I paid ~$[money] and he paid only ~$[money] from costco.So, I brought one myself. Epson print better photo than HP 1115.If you think of buying this printer, try Epson first.Also, the driver of HP 1115 doesn't work with my Iomega CR-RW andmy new Epson printer together. Bad software driver!!!	0
I have not placed eyes on the original, but it seems all pictures are correctly placed. His honest old fashioned opinion comes to life when he explains he does not appreciate the safe way to carry his axe. I enjoy the tone and ease of reading, you definitely catch on to the vernacular of the time. A great piece of history that impart practices that still having meaning to this day.	1
I did not really care for this book. I found the plot messy and muddled, with many clumsy devices and scenes that felt forced (the climax, in particular, seemed very rushed, cinematically speaking). The characters, for the most part, were thin - and perhaps the author reached too far in casting the reference-net. I wanted to like it (I very much enjoyed Alan Moore's tales of the Extraordinary Gentlemen's League)... A very intriguing idea though (I give the acorn a golden prize but the oak grew sickly)... Maybe it is your thing; it was not mine.	0
I still do not understand how this guy is getting more attention than the winner of AI, but that said, how can anyone listen to this CD and not think that he has a voice for Broadway and only Broadway. He punctuates every single syllable, lighten up Clay!The music on the CD is catchy, but the voice behind the music is just plain annoying.	0
When I received the item it sounded like the DVD had come off the lock. I gave it to my daughter for a present and she just opened it today and it is scratched.	0
I was not so excited about the price but the good reviews on Amazon convinced me to purchase it for my boys. They are 1 and 2. They love it! This set is HUGE. Make sure you have space in your home for something like this. We put it between our two sofas in the living room for now. We plan to move it to their playroom as soon as we do some rearranging in there. The boys have knocked it down playing rough inside the hut. It just pops right back. The setup was super easy. If you don't have a room big enough for the entire play hut then it can easily be setup into two smaller units that are still fun. Great buy. I wished I would have discovered this sooner. This would have really helped out during our snow days and just really cold days when we just didn't leave the house. Also, I plan to take some parts of this unit when we travel this summer.	1
The ultimate, classic Big American Horn. I've been playing one for 25 years and it has never let me down. Everyone has their preferences, so I can't recommend it to everybody, but at least give it a try before you make you decision to spend this amount of money.	1
It's back to the good old days.The action packed Schwarzennegger films where the kill-shot reigns with side-splitting dialogue.Problem is! Robert Patrick is the star. John Cena makes a credible Arnold but Mr. Patrick does a wonderful villain. He's got the lines and he's nailed the perfect bad guy with a flair that would make Hannibal Lecter cringe. A great job by the former star of The X-Files who made John Doggett a memorable experience.Action and blowup sequences are A-1 all the way.The perfect film for escapist violence.	1
...It is awful, truly one of the worst books that I've ever read...Good writing does not not to be defended like this, and the need to defend a book in this way prety much proves that it is a substandard work.	0
I have nothing good to say about Kingston memory. I tried installing this module in an E-machines T1220 1.2 GHz Celeron system that is only 3 months old and no go. Wouldn't work in two other systems I tried. The same spec memory from Centon and PNY both worked without any problems. Mine is going back.	0
I got this book because I was writing a research paper on palmistry. Out of the five books and two web sites I used as sources, this one was the most informative. Some of the books were witten as if they were trying to confuse the reader. This one had interseting anecdotes and asy to follow illustrations and discriptions.	1
Excellent book. I've read all but a few pages. I was very touched by Mr Bok's description of his childhood as a slave. A few years ago I'd heard that the Sudan had some problems; after reading this book I have a little idea of those problems in general and of slavery in particular. I strongly recommend this book.	1
With this small handheld game, you can think of almost anything and it will guess it even if a few questions are incorrect. This is probably the BEST BUY out of all handhelds. Never gets old.	1
This scale is great. It is very accurate and is also accurate for repeatability. It's easy to read. It came mostly assembled. I only had to screw 2 parts together.I would highly recommend it for anyone that wants accuracy to a quarter pound.	1
I absolutely love these diapers! My daughter is 13 months old now and I cannot think of more than 1 or 2 times these have ever leaked. Even when she sleeps through the entire night and wakes up soaked, they hold an enormous amount of liquid!I tried the cruisers once, now that my daughter can run around, but I like the baby dry still. I find that the stretchy waistbands allow the diaper to fall down when she's active, but maybe that's not the case with everybody. Since these are looser around the stomach they also seem more comfortable, and my daughter doesn't rip them off immediately like some of the other stretchy brands.	1
I saw this toy in Delhi but purchased in Australia. I found it to be a simple in operation and very intelligent. I found it captures the attention of not only children but adults as well. I would like to buy this toy in Shanghai,China and gift it to children known to me. Please tell me how to procure it in China and its cost.	1
I don't know what they used for a test truck, but it would not fit on mine. I followed the installation instructions and it just wasn't working out. I am a heavy DIY'er and have replaced many exhaust systems in my time. Dynomax needs to retest this system on my truck. The left tailpipe that crosses over from the muffler kept hitting the OEM muffler heat shield. The right side wasn't much better.Also I could not locate the tailpipe hanger holes in the frame as Dynomax install instructions said they supposed to be. After fighting with it for a while trying to make it work one way or another. I removed it and put it back into the box and sent it back.I have installed a few Dynomax systems on various vehicles with no problems at all. This one just didn't cut it.I purchased a Flowmaster single exhaust pipe system and installation was a piece of cake.I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS DYNOMAX #17313 FOR YOUR TRUCK.AMAZON'S return policy on this item is excellent.	0
"Crass, vulgar, ridiculous farce of a film that regrettably retains none of the keen psychological portraits in Jackson's novel. Believe me, I am no stickler for slavish literary adaptations. When changes need to be made for cinematic purposes, I utterly support a director's choice to do so. Here, however, Jackson's work is not even on display in spirit; instead, this juvenile, special effects laden mess is marred by a juvenile screenplay and lousy performances from good actors. Even Liam Neeson publicly declared his utter disgust with this production. If only the filmmakers had taken the Robert Wise film version as inspiration; it is by no means faultless but is a masterpiece compared to this dreck. Only those folks who adore CGI will appreciate this film, and to them I say ""enjoy."" To those looking for characters or true chills, try ""The Innocents,"" ""The Changeling,"" ""The Legend of Hell House,"" or the original ""The Haunting"" instead."	0
This is a reprint of the 1906 edition. Linotype and monotype were recent technological innovations. The Helvetica typeface was 50 years in the future. No one had yet thought of using endnotes rather than footnotes. A hyphen is recommended in cases such as: ice-cream, wave-length, common-sense, fountain-head, and view-point.A mildly amusing antique, but not useful for anyone actually doing writing, editing, or publishing.	0
Sultry summer nights, passion, music, and a bit of mayhem... Sterling Watson's SWEET DREAM BABY is an unforgettable novel by a wonderful writer more people should know about. (What I want to know is, where is the sequel?)	1
"I used to watch ""A Charlie Brown Christmas"" every year as a child and now my kids love to watch it. Even now, I'll sit and watch it with them-anytime of year. More importantly, this Christmas story emphasizes the true meaning of Christmas-something I'm happy to have my children watching."	1
Oh how I love this book!Vimala Thakar writes beautifully and gives you lots to think about.I bought this book as it was on the suggested reading list by OM Girl (its a blog). Then I went on to buy her other book on Raja Yoga. She is elegant and insightful and I am so glad I found her.I will keep this book forever and one day when I am a more skilled Yoga Teacher, I will use it in my class and read the quotes.	1
"Love, love, love! Got this for a ""beach read"" & fell in love with the characters. Very well written with no slow, boring parts."	1
DO NOT BUY THIS CD! DO NOT BE FOOLED! This CD is not by NSYNC. It is by some no name cover band. I got taken once before by Amazon with a Ricky Martin single. I couldn't return it since I had opened it. So if you are looking for the CD single Bye Bye Bye, don't get this one. You will be dissapointed and stuck with a CD that is worthless and unreturnable once you open it. I got lucky and thought the cover of this one looked suspicious and was right. I promptly returned it. So always be careful and double check.	0
If you're read one of Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels, you don't need to know this is a fantastic read. But Planer's narration also does a marvelous job of bringing the characters to life. The accents and voices are wonderful! If you're driving, jogging, or even folding laundry, this audio narration is perfect for those times when you can't pick up the book and read for yourself.	1
I don't see why the producers bothered making this movie. It adds nothing to the Kirk Douglas version of Ulysses made in 1955, besides a few limited CGI effects. Even Douglas's beard was preferable to Assante's mullet hairstyle in this version. This has stripped out all of the sex and most of the violence that is in the original Homer.What we have here is a TV movie made in 4x3 format back in 1997, but finally released on DVD in 2004 to cash in on the 'TROY' blockbuster. It was made to be acceptable to the US TV market, but I suspect the production team was European.To my knowledge, there has yet to be a good film/TV adaptation of the Odyssey. The best dramatisation so far is a recent audiobook dramatisation by the BBC starring Tim McInerney.	0
great movie!!! cage is a great druggie i mean for being a cop. what a way to gain trust from the bad folk's.	1
This movie was awesome!!! But is the Deluxe Edition going to be available for Full-Screen????????????????????	1
Just when I thought it could get any worse than Iron Maiden's Rock in Rio or Dance of Death tour dvds, the Scorpions appeared to have hired the same camera, film and editing crew of those aforementioned releases. A great performance no doubt but the editing makes this unwatchable. Just an overpriced dvd to play when the tube is turned off.	0
"This entire CD is on the one. Of course ""Atomic Dog"" is the main cut, however ""Man's Best Friend"" is also a funky type of ""Knee Deep"" groove. ""Loopzilla"" is also a good song to dance to. The title cut ""Computer Games"" is as crazy as the artist. LOL. However, this album has a Funkadelic overtone. With musicians like Bootsy, Bernie, Mike, Junie, Eddie Hazel, Garry Shider and ect ect. it's worth buying. I think this is the best George Clinton album of all time. It's a R&B; Clssid and for the life of me I don't understand why it did not make the national top 40. Even the title cut went to 80 something on the charts. Go figure. George did get a award for the best video of that year.Go for ur funk"	1
I didn't like this book very much. It was silly. I'm sorry that I've wasted time reading this book. There are better books to read.	0
"Also ich finde es ja toll, dass ein deutscher Film in den USA so gut ankommt, aber ich habe ihn bei uns in Deutschland im Kino gesehen und dachte mir ""wie lange rennt die denn noch"" und ""warum rennt die schon wieder"". Mein Freundin fand den Film aber echt klasse. Von den vier Leuten die wir waren gibt einer 5 Sterne, 2 geben drei Sterne und ich gebe dem Film 2 Sterne. W√ºrde ihn mir aber niemals auf DVD oder Video kaufen."	0
I first purchased this book nearly 20 years ago, and each time I re-read it I find new and fascinating things within. There is no doubt that this is a meticulously researched and crafted novel, and we all learn to identify with the waif Ayla as she struggles to survive with her new family.However I must say that even though I have read and enjoyed all the books in the series so far (one just has to know how Ayla is faring!), this is by far THE strongest and best. The characterisations are strong, and the trials and tribulations of the clan believable. Please don't be put off by the success of the series, this book is a gem which can more than stand by itself.	1
If you don't mind the liberal propaganda and the way Berry totally ignores any Scripture that contradicts his agenda, you may enjoy this book. It is a page-turner. However, when the third secret is finally revealed, it is quite anti-climatic after all the build-up it was given. I was expecting something apocolyptic and got the Democratic platform for social policy instead. Conservative Catholics and all Christians who happen to believe the Bible is true will find the book offensive.	0
We really like all the Pampers diapers we've used. They are comfortable for our baby and they seem to do a great job.	1
The Zajirushi NS-ZCC10 rice cooker really does turn cheap and unappetizing rice into something delicious. I tested it with a batch of old cheap rice that was sitting in the cabinet (and with good reason) and it remarkably transformed the taste. The rice raw had that familiar unappealing smell to it that reflected its poor taste but after being cooked with this rice cooker there was no trace of it. Excellent product.	1
i have read this book over and over. it never bores meno matter what stage of life i am at the book reflects the times we live inpoliticians never change and always practice the art of deception.people seem to become more and more like sheep blindly following authority.if you have the above sentiments you will enjoy this book immensely	1
I bought these diapers not realizing that they were the baby dry. I usually use the swaddlers and I love them. So when I noticed these ones were different I thought it would be okay. No way!!! I used about 5 diapers and my 2 month old son blew out of every single one...keep in mind we have never had any blow outs before. So I definately would never recommend these diapers to anyone. Now I am stuck with 270 diapers I will never use...ugh	0
This book is the perfect kickoff to the greatest and most amazing Science-Fiction series ever. Asimov and his Foundation are the foundation of all modern science fiction. This book especially is a fascinating story full of characters so real you could expect to bump into them on the street, to speak nothing of the Doctor's amazing - and totally beleivable - futuristic technology.If you want to get a transcendental, literary experience or you just want to read a damn fine story, the Foundation series - and especially this book - are what you're looking for.	1
This is my mom's account. I had the pleasure of reading this book in English this year. I can honestly say, it is the single most boring book I've EVER read. You will NEVER find someone my age that enjoys this story. It has no action! No suspense! It isn't deep! Things don't symbolize anything. If they do, then you're thinking too hard. This book is not a classic. It is the worst. I'd recommend copying a dictionary before I'd ask you to read this pile. DO NOT EVEN THINK OF BUYING THIS.	0
This is one movie where the title makes as much sense as the content. I gave it one star, although Franka deserves five stars for fitness.	0
This is about the trials and tribulations of a multigenerational family.We found it disengaging and rather tedious. It went on and on without getting far at the beginning and we started skipping scenes to see if it picked up. In the end we abandoned it.I'd hoped for more from a movie with Saif Ali Khan, Salman Khan & Karisma Kapoor but this was 1999 and I guess it wasn't among their better stuff. The music and dance was ho-hum and unmemorable too.Elsewhere on the Net it scores average. However it was below average for us and not a keeper.	0
Funny, funny funny...Unrestrained junior academic high jinks that will have your 14 year old, (and not to mention, YOURSELF) sprinting violently out of the room and into the streets screaming loud uproarious praise for this once-in-a-lifetime masterpiece. This little jem of a purchase is a must for anyonetired of the usual hollywood fair. The character of Mark is by far the biggest scene-stealer in this shining cast of adolescent thespians! I have seen the glorious future and it has a name : Hail Maximus Keeble!	0
When I ordered this book, I was hoping to get a book for my daughter that would teach her about the Catholic saints. I think this book is better read under the influence of hallucinogenics or in a state of temporary insanity. I don't know where the author is coming from. Take this review however you want. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS BOOK.	0
The item was delivered earlier than expected, arrived exactly as described (NEW), and a perfect transaction. Thank you!!!!!	1
I would like to give this seller a very high rating. This move arrived in great condition and was everything I had thought it would be.	1
After carefully opening the player, reading the entire instruction manual and following it to the letter, the player froze up. I can not accurately describe my anger. I bought this thing because reviews said it was the most customer friendly. If it didn't cost me $125, I would have run it over with my car. Do yourself a favor, avoid the Rhomba at all costs.	0
I enjoyed the rest of the series, but I found this book boring compared to the rest. Much of the story is spent on a ship, and I did not feel that the characters that were introduced were developed very well. The other books in the series are much better.	0
I was a huge fan of Pampers Baby Dry. With my first child, I faithfully used the Pampers Baby Dry diapers for over two and half years with no complaints at all. I recommended them to friends and family members with babies. With my second child, who is now one year old, I returned to Baby Dry since they worked so well with my first. I don't know what they changed about the diapers, but the diapers continuously explode. I don't leave them on for longer than two hours at a time. Sometimes, the diaper feels completely dry and it still has exploded. The inside of the diaper is also irritating to my son's skin. I am tired of vacuuming up clumps of diapers. This happens to at least one diaper a day. I'm done. I am cancelling my subscription tonight and returning the last box which I haven't opened.	0
The author in the preface says that he expects this book to be a complete reference for Tomcat. I would say that it falls far short of the objective.I had expected a meaningful look at Tomcat. Most of the information presented is already available with the standard Tomcat distribution. There is no attempt to go beyond the surface. It seems the author was in a rush to get a book published, rather than spend time providing some insight into Tomcat.There is no proper introduction to the terms or concepts related to Tomcat. I don't expect an introduction to servlets or JSP. All I ask for is clear concise definitions of the various Tomcat components and a breakdown of the config files.If you are intrested in finding more about Tomcat stick to looking for the information online. It will be time well spent.	0
C.S. Lewis was a wonderful writer, to say the least. I was quite excited when I got this book in the mail and saw it was in basically excellent shape.	1
"When I first heard Ra's ""From Zero"" I was in awe. A band that used cool effects, Egyptian scales, and was moderately heavy--the perfect mix for me. Then, Duality came out.Duality demonstrates a lack of creativity that was once there in Ra. I wouldn't say they evolved, I'd say they devoled. They still use effects, but rarely and they don't have as big of an impact. On top of that they hardly sound Egyption on the album. As for this album, Ra sounds more like other bands, but they are still distinct. I just wish they went in a different direction.I do want to say that their are some really awesome songs like Fallen Angels, Undertaken, and Taken. The other tracks are bad either, it's just that I expected a whole lot more."	0
"I was so thrilled with vol. 1 ""Into the Wilderness"" that I ordered the second volume from the library before investing money into a hardcover version. I'm glad I didn't buy one as it was the most disappointing book since I read Kate Morton.""Into the Wilderness"" was so promising and I really wonder how the sequel can be so shallow?This whole journey from Montr√©al, Canada, to Dumfries, Scotland, used up close to 300 pages in the book and when Nathaniel and Elizabeth are finally in Scotland, things don't get any more interesting.What a boring read!Zero stars was not possible, so I have to give it 1 star :(.I hope ""Lake in the Clouds"" will be better, but if it's only about Hannah, I doubt I will read it.I was hoping to read more about Nathaniel and Elizabeth."	0
I brought this for my friend name Brian, for his birthday I figured he needed his very own Jasper!	0
I'd ordered these boots based on decent reviews and price. I rarely return purchases to Amazon but I did return these. The boots were fairly heavy, stiff and narrow. I get that new boots will be stiff but both the uppers and lowers were too stiff for me. I returned them and bought Adidas boots with Gore Tex uppers which were much more comfortable, flexible and light with good sole traction.	0
Purchased these socks looking for the right balance of light construction and cushioning. I found only the light construction part. While they seem durable enough, the socks are way too light to provide an adequate barrier between my shoes and my feet. It's easy to earn a blister on anything more than a short run.These may be just right for someone who does not punish their feet with marathons and triathlons, but just not substantial enough for me.	0
This film truly shows how filmmakers attempt to ride success. This movie is really bad. Even with some new blood (or should I say blonde) I couldn't hardly stand to finish the whole thing. But I did. What a waste.	0
After reading SUMMER OF MY GERMAN SOLDIER, I would definetely recommend it to young adults and adults alike!	1
Not a fan of these diapers. I have a son, and these diapers leaked all the time. I usually use Huggies and they rarely leak! Thought I would try these because I love the Swaddlers for newborns. Looks like I will be switching back to Huggies.	0
I agree with the others here, HP are useless and I should have known better. Paper jams all the time using laser quality paper kept in a humidity controlled environment. Every copy you have to feed through manually.I couldjust about live with that but it doesn't scan either!! It says it'sscanning, it sounds like it's scanning - it even says image sent to the computer after scanning but do any images appear?? Do they heck!! Still under warranty, I've had a replacement unit and still the same and the HP techie team, (based in India!) can't help - it's going back!!	0
These diapers are terrible. I have been using the Pampers Cruisers and those work well. I thought I would try the Baby Dry for overnight. Every night my baby wets right through these. I have to change his entire outfit during the night, which really wakes him up and makes it difficult for him to go back to sleep. Sometimes I have to change him twice. I will not be buying these again.	0
Clay's debut album is amazing. Every track is very good listening. There are fast, slow and mid tempo songs. Clay's voice is superb! He has delivered a wonderful first CD that is able to be enjoyed by fans of all ages. He sings songs about a variety of subjects from all relationship angles. Just hearing this CD is uplifting. Excellent!	1

This game looked great on the box and that is all I got out of it.Due yourself a favor and check to make sure your system can handle a game of this high speed and graphics.Called the game company waste of time then checked with my computer manufactor another waste of time.If you think you got a old system then stay away from this game unless your looking to waste a day trying to install and it will never happen.	0
At first impression, I loved the HyperPak ... however - after about a week's worth of using, the memory side of the pak became corrupted and crashed on me - and the rumble side sometimes goes off on its own tangent and does whatever it wants to.The rumble, however, is still operational and a great feature - the 2x rumble really makes games come alive ...	0
This is a wonderful, quiet and relaxing CD that I find Iput on quite often. MB has a wonderful voice that canjust about sing anything. If you want good music try thisCD and then look up and find the rest of his music. Hewasn't awarded England's top male singer in the past 25 yearsfor nothing. He certainly is my favorite singer and I willcontinue to purchase every album and every video he puts out.	1
Just like a real museum, everything in Namco Museum is OLD. I grew up in the 80's. I played Atari and Colico. I remember Pong, Missile Command and many others. I remember that they only kept my attention for about twenty minutes at a time.	0
Oh Great just what America needs, another souless, overhyped no talent John Mayer wannabe. I haven't and won't buy this cd but workong in a record store I had to check it out and see what all the fuss was. The songs are poorly written and meaningless. Clay himself sounds as if he belongs in a highschool production of Grease. Don't waste your time and money on this. If you actually like this kind of drab souless music just pick up John Mayer's new cd, at least he sounds like a talented singer rather than a aspiring drama queen with a sore throat.	0
Did not use as my G.I. Dr. said that a recent study showed that they do not help.	0
A good book constantly makes you wonder what is going to happen next. It makes you care about the characters. It stirs emotion. It keeps you on the edge of your seat. It makes you want to go back to it and keep reading.The Third Secret does none of these.	0
Deceivers will rise up from among you and deceive many.This book is just a copycat of many books before it from Richard Foster,etal. This list of so-called Disciplines is straight from Richard Foster's Spiritual Formation curriculum, in which the occultist centering prayer method is taught. It is occultist to the core, but dressed up nicely as Christian.	0
This was a present for my grandma, she loves it, nuff said. Not my type of music, but hey as long as she is happy.	1
I have loved this film ever since it was first made, but this DVD really does not do it justice.Despite being called a 'special edition', it contains not a single extra feature. The widescreen format is not anamorphic, which means that the MPEG aspect ratio is 4:3 and the picture resolution of the viewable area is lower than it should be. The quality of the film print used is poor and contains scratches and white speckling. The film has also had some bits edited out, so I suppose you could say it contains a negative number of special features: i.e. some normal features taken out. This is a shocking misuse of the format because the DVD standard contains the possibility for having optional scenes which can be shielded from young viewers, so why wasn't this used?I doubt it will be long before the next version comes out, the 'collector's special edition' or whatever they will call it, so my advice would be to wait for that.	0
This group bills it's self as the original Key West the Band so I tried it out because I like that group.No contest!If I were Key West the Band I would sue for misrepresentation!I tried listening to this music but it was tough to make it all the way thru.Bad, clique lyrics and songs.The singer is good but can't make up for the horrible songs and grainy recording techniques.Maybe next time -- but I doubt it.	0
The poster arrived quickly, but it was very poor quality. It was blurry and was obviously a photo of the real thing that was then blown up on a copy machine. I emailed the supplier multiple times with no response. I called and was given instructions on how to return the poster. Sent it back, but no credit to my account or acknowledgement. I finally gave up, which is what they probably expected. Won't do service with this supplier again.	0
Bill Engvall is totally funny in this video, espically when he talks about taking his F16 flight.	1
"I simply could not finish reading this book. The characters' lives and their family lines twist in and out of each other until the tangled mess is too difficult to decipher. The magical, surreal quality of some of the stories felt ""cheesy"" and not very convincing. I do not understand what the big fuss is about this book. I quit after about 100 pages."	0
After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this book. This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station.	1
This book was very boring. The characters were not exiting and difinitly not interesting. The book was not badly writin just had a bad plot. The characters like kit had no adventures or exitment. If that is what you are looking for I recomend you get a differnt you get a book. I do not think the characters were very exiting and did not work to make the plot interesting or adventurues. That is why don't think the book is good. If this book was non-fiction I would have understood.	0
In the forward, the author remarks that this book will never be used as a textbook in any of the high-level military schools. This is a pity. It is easy to understand the successes achieved by Adm. Gallery's units throughout WWII, and while he is much more modest than other senior officers, there can be little doubt that he is the reason for all these victories. Not only is this a wonderful book for anyone who aspires to be a leader, but it is a tremendously amusing and well-written book.	1
Stays in place even on my slippery end tables. Keeps coffee warm...better in some of my ceramic mugs than others....tall mugs that are wider at the top, don't heat up to the top, but generally my normal size mugs are kept at a drinkable temperature allowing me to enjoy my coffee for a longer time. The cord is exceptionally long....nice perk. Has a turn on turn off button, with a red alert light when on. Nice purchase.	1
Short and simple: This charger did not charge my laptop's battery unless the computer was either off or at least in standby mode with the lid closed.It could keep the computer operating while plugged in, but it wouldn't charge my battery. I've seen other reviews with different results, but for me, this thing was pretty much useless.	0
Not one of the ear gels worked. Feel like I got ripped off. The ear gels are headed to the trash can where they belong.	0
Music is what happens between the notes, someone said. I read Communion, I listened to the audio book reading by Roddy McDowell. As skeptical as I am inclined, both versions got me and gave me vibes of high weirdness. While I listened and read, I bought it. So when I got hold of the video, I was hopeful. But FILMING it and making it a visual treatment hit a brick wall. I watched, found myself saying every few minutes, 'oh give me a Break!', or 'You can't be serious..' I believed Strieber's account LESS after watching. A reading, either on paper or listening to a story teller, reaches inside the mind. Film is for the eyes, visuals first.If you want to test plausibility, take the mystery out of the shady corners inside the mind and put it out front, under lights and cameras. If you can translate it, you might have credibility left.	0
R A Tore is one of my hero's of past years, i try to read all of his writeings that i can find.This one on being filled with the Holy Spirit is one of the best, i suggest all Christians read it if they are truly wanting to server the God Heaven.	1

My 6 year old daughter enjoyed the toy and loved taking care of it, but after less than a month the toy stopped working. It wasn't a matter of the batteries; it simply ceased functioning. It was quite distressing for my daughter, as she had spent so much time building up the her pet's health, intelligence, happiness, neopoints, and trophies, and they were all lost forever. Because she had put so much time into it and personalized it, she felt like her pet died, and it was a loss.	0
excellent product, but has a very short range of reception and battery life is short lived. You have to adjust the tuner several times before obtaining a good picturem, but not bad for a childs toy as beginner. would recommend to younger kids because it is a fun toy.	1
This is a good book for creating critical thinking in the reader of the Four Agreements. It is a resource to allow the reader the chance to look introspectively and motivate the reader to grow in the Toltec Wisdom.	1
This was very gory. I got it for my husband, as he is an avid snowmobile rider. After watching part of this... I don't know if I'll ever let him go to the mountains with his buddies, without supervision, anymore.... LOL	0
Harvey knows his stuff, which is obviously based on years and years of experience and seeing it all. The would-be and budding entrepreneur would be well advised to heed his advice. This book stresses the importance of working ON your business, not just IN your business.	1
My old stereo amp was going to die, so I needed a replacement.All I need was a simple stereo amp and this product seemed to be the best fit with great price!Well, it has automatic power on/off function based on the input.So, when there's no input, it turns off automatically to save power.The problem is, even if you turn off the function, it still works so basically it turns on and off all the time while I listen the music.It could have been a great one if it did not have this quality issue.I am returning the product.	0
Don't get me wrong - it's not a cure or a perfect product. But - for such little money, if you suffer from tendinitis, this support can't be beat. I found it from a fellow golfer who said it was the only one that helped her. It has to do with the unique element that sort of digs into the arm.The great thing about it is not bulky. I too can where it sleeping or awake... If you've tried everything else, give it a shot...And of course RICE : Rest, Ice, Compression and Elevation	1
Great American classic that you can get for free on kindle. I was supposed to read this back in high school but wasn't not interested at the time. But now with the benefit of age I can really appreciate it.	1
This is the only official history of the giant utility that serves most of northern and central California. Written in 1950, when the company (and its official biographer) were heedless of the changes that the future held in store for the energy industry overall (and utilities in particular) as well as for the end of unbridled growth and development in the state of California. Coleman is a real booster for PG&E. If you want the PR line, from the generation that build the company between 1930 and the 1950, this is the reference book you want.	0
"While I couldn't put it down - I feel like I just finished a LONG outline. Great concepts throughout, makes me want to get out the telescope and look at the moon again and say ""what if"".Weber's style reminds me of WEB Griffin or Beowulf - each chapter peeking in on an hour in the action, spread over months or years, villains or heros dispatched with alacrity and gore. This could have been a framework for a whole series of books in the hands of another author, perhaps delving deeper into the characters and the worlds. But I certainly appreciate the classic scifi visions."	1
"This is good music, but I really have a problem with some of the lyrics.For instance, Sunshowers:""You wanna win a war? Like PLO I don't surrender""""It's a bomb yo, so run yo, put away your stupid gun yo... that's why we blow it up before we go""""they showed him a picture then, ain't that you with the muslims?""Now I'm not one for censorship, but I can't back someone glorifying PLO and terrorism in dance music. That's just ridiculous. I know reggae has roots of being somewhat violent and rebellious back at its early roots, but I absolutely can't sponsor these messages. It's just wrong."	0
What is the point of this book? It doesn't have one, in my opinion. The author himself said that the reason for writing it was that he wanted to write a book about incest! I really do not enjoy graphic descriptions of this incest, either. I would not reccommend it to anyone, in fact, I tell others NOT to read it. I wouldn't have read past the tenth page if I hadn't been required to for my English class.	0
My muffler on my 2000 Cherokee was starting to leak. This kit is the lowest cost one I could find. It took ~ 1.5 hours to remove to old one and ~ 10 minutes to install the new one. Did not need the flange piece. Sounds ~ the same as the OEM. Wonder if I can get 9+ years out of it like the OEM. (The rest of the Jeep may rust out long before)	1
I absolutely agree with all previous reviews: great movie, but it should be in widescreen version on DVD. Otherwise I can watch it on tv. I hope that someday I'll be able to buy the widescreen version.	0
"Start with ""Willie Nelson Sings Kris Kristofferson."" Better yet, get anything recorded by Kris, himself, until the last decade or so. Despite having a voice that ""sounds like a frog,"" as he once put it, the early versions are best by Kristofferson, because nobody else conveys the same feelings or sings his lyrics with such expressiveness as he does. Even his performances are just too rote in live performance or later rerecordings, though."	0
The bolt holes don't line up. They are skewed. The paint on it was not complete, there were bare metal spots on it.	0
I purchased this toolkit from Amazon along with a very high quality Wiha nut driver set (26592). As others have stated, the nut driver is not reversible. It looks to me like the single nut driver is designed to fit both a 2.2 hex nut and a 2.2 - 2.5 star hex nut.However, the Phillips screwdriver is a size 0, and the Costco reading glasses I have that have screws takes a #1 Phillips head screwdriver. The one in this kit is too small.In addition, the Costco reading glasses that I have which have a nut (Design Optics Slim Elite), use a 3.0 mm nut.Don't purchase this for Costco reading glasses.I gave the product a single star because of the misleading description which implies two nut drivers. The single, combo nut driver looks very roughly made compared to the Wiha tools.	0
As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book.	0
For whatever reason this deplorable bootleg has not been pulled from the market, nor has bootleg vendor OZIT been sued yet. If you want to hear the real, legitimate, officially released BAT CHAIN PULLER, please buy the edition that the Zappa Family Trust is releasing as of February 2012. Don't say you weren't warned about this shoddy ripoff!	0
I ordered three rods (all black) of various sizes and received free shipping. When the order was received, one of the rods was in pewter. They agreed to send a return shipping label for the incorrect item, but I would have to pay shipping on one rod.	0
From a woman who sold out her body ages ago and now attempts to be a partisan hack, and poorly at that. Why anyone would want to wipe their feet on this dirty carpet is beyond me. Not worth the time it took to phone in sex.	0
"The first time I saw Clay on American Idol, in his audition, I said to myself ""theres the winner"". The first time I listened to Clay's album, I said to myself ""theres a winner who has been turned into a junky commercialized pop-culture phenomena, exploited with traditional sappy songs that were handed to him by writers, and oversung in a way that only a person who has sung 100 songs on TV that all sound exactly the same can.""Poor Clay- in a small dose, he has a fine voice. Heck, he could make a really good Broadway performer with his ability to belt 'em out. It's prefabricated crap like this CD that makes me want to spew.A star for Clay's talent, and one for pity. This album truly deserves no credit, because none of it came from the heart."	0
I've used this book in the undergraduate Romanticism courses I teach, and found it quite useful. It is brief, brisk, and cleanly written, and serves as a good introduction to Byron. You won't find a lot of subtle insights into Byron's more obscure works here, but you will see how the life and the work converge and, at times, diverge. If you want to know more about Byron than you can find out from an anthology introduction, but don't want to plough through (or have your students plough through) one of the long biographies, this is the book for you. If you want geat detail and a full, scholarly treatment, you'll have to go elsewhere, though. Peters isn't catering to those needs.	1
"I am 5'3"" and weigh 100lbs and have very tiny hands and wrists. These weights are so tiny, and they barely stretch, so I can hardly even get them on my wrists. Plus, the 1 lb weight is not nearly enough for me."	0
This movie made me naseous. Honestly, not a big Transformer or Bay fan, but this is pretty poor. For the triple digit millions of dollars they threw at this they could have had a more realistic intro- JFK and Nixon computer generated persons throw the shark before the movie even gets the story going. There is no suspension of disbelief built up in this, building off of our hope of talking cars instead of making us believe. Bay's hyperkinetic style makes me feel naseous, even though I like the Bourne movies. There is just no rhyme or reason to anything in these movies. I guess thats ok for some people, but for the rest of us we'll be left wondering why people can spend $600mill on ticket sales for this instead of something with a real heart.	0
I thought that The Scarlet letter was a great piece of Literature and was a brave step for Hawthorne to take in this book during the time he wrote it. I would definatly recommend this to other readers.	1
I love Pampers diapers, and this is the cheapest place to buy them by far!! I used to shop at sams and when i switched to amazon moms i saved $20 a month, not much but a lot with a toddler. We tried every brand out there and every one of them leaked exept for Pampers. And with this price, why buy off brand?	1
"What a delightful work of art. I was enchanted with the film and the music definitely caught my attention. I'm always looking for a little ""off beat"" music, i.e., Chocolat was my last favorite CD, but now this has moved up to first place. I highly recommend it for ecclectic music lovers who like that ""off beat, out of the way, different"" sound."	1
"We checked this dvd out from the library a couple of months before our son's second birthday, and we knew right away we would have to buy one for our home. He would wake up in the morning and beg, ""Elmo Firetruck House?"" He learned all about firefighters and firetrucks. We bought him a firetruck and hat for his birthday and he plays with them while watching this dvd. The firefighters in the video are actual firefighters, and they did a great job of teaching what to do in a fire. We all love this one!"	1
The cover fits reasonably well, with only slight shifting. It does not obstruct any of the controls, display, the mouthpiece or the earpiece. I really like the clip on the back. I'm pretty satisfied overall.	1
"What a lousy soundtrack for a suprisingly fun movie. Some of the actual score pieces are decent, but NONE of Elton's songs on this album are worth even a brief listen. Save your money and buy ""Goodbye Yellow Brick Road"" or ""Madman Across the Water."""	0
This mattress began leaking after only 3 or 4 nights of use. I found the leakbetween a crease in the top (flocked) side. After proper repair effort it wasunable to stay inflated. I have put the air bed to better use. Thank youKeith Colton	0
Clay Aiken is one of the most talented singers out there. Not only does he have a voice from heaven but is an all around nice guy. What I love the most about this guy is that he's not afraid to be himself. He doesn't follow the fads and raunchy behavior the music industry is so used to. Clay is so unique, refreshing and is a joy to listen to. I am a fan forever!!! I absolutely love his voice, music and of course the man.	1
I though this was a great film mainly because of the acting, Patrick Stewart, best known as Captain Picard from Star Trek the Next Generation, fits the Character of Ahab perfectly. Though the film looses a star for the quite dodgy special effects, Herman Mellville's story and A cast of great actors lift it up into a classic.	1
"I was thrilled when I heard about this toy, because I love the website 20q.net , which is truly genius. Unfortunately this toy is not as smart as the website, perhaps due to memory constraints. The first two things I tried with it were ""a cardboard box"" and ""an alien"" and it didn't get either one. This is troublesome because the surprise and wonder of using the website comes from its ability to guess even the most obscure and outlandish things (a stork, a game boy). This toy cannot guess those things, so you must ask guests to choose more obvious things, taking the fun out of it. [...]."	0
This product definitely does what is said to do. I haven't had any problems with it and its not too thick and the power is great.	1
I have to disagree with the reviewers who gave this book high marks. While Jim Richey is very knowledgeable, this book is a set of one-page clippings from various past magazines. The drawings are very basic, and there's not a single photograph to help the beginning to moderate woodworker. These tips are too basic for the advanced woodworker, so I really don't see an audience for this book. It didn't help me at all. There's nothing wrong with the book -- if you want to read about other people's woodworking. However, to help you build your router skills there are wiser ways to spend your money. Several are sold right here on Amazon.	0
"I have to admit I was a bit skeptical about buying this CD at first. I hadn't watched AI 2 but had heard by word-of-mouth and various reviews/articles about Clay Aiken. I also heard ""This is the Night"" and BOTW and was impressed. I bought the CD and was instantly won over!! THIS GUY CAN SING!!! How refreshing it is these days to hear someone like this in contrast to other music in the mainstream. All of the songs on MOAM are fantastic. I LOVE IT!! SO WILL YOU!"	1
As far as I know, this is the first book on SQLite and for that Chris Newman deserves a compliment.Beyond that, this book is not very useful though:1) It explains some basic SQL syntax but I didn't buy this book to learn SQL.2) Very little information about the specifics and pitfalls of SQLite syntax, I rarely find what I'm looking for.3) Being a PHP developer I don't need the chapters on C++, Perl, TCL and Python (about 25% of the book).	0
Recieved this item and it was broken. Tried to contact the seller but could not. As per amazon's return policy this is a non-returnable item. Which makes sense. Unless it is sold in a non-working condition. Was very displeased I could not speak directly with the seller and that amazon was of no help. Had to go through the manufacture to have the product replaced which is still a work in progress. Will not buy non-returnable items from this site again. Leaves too much room to get a defective product like I did and be stuck with it.	0
Explanations are clear and concise....which is what I needed. Includes sample code to illustrate points made.	1
I'm fairly tall and this could go on someone taller then me, with no problem. I love that you can't see it under clothes. I notice my back feel better with it on, my posture improves, and I look good in my clothes. I love this!	1
This movie was made to be a fantasy/martial arts movie, and it delivers as promised. I have a very extensive collection of Martial Arts movies and I can honestly say that this movie is one of my top 15 favorite movies. I gave it a 4 instead of a five because it does go a little overboard with the fantasy element, but not enough to distract you from the fighting, and believe me, there's a lot of it.	1
This is a magnificent book. It details the horrors of war and the inhumane conditions POWs were forced to face, but it also is a carefully crafted tale of friendship, and how people can thrive in the most unlikely places. I disagree with the reviewer who thinks it is a depressing book - it is a novel of the human spirit, with a dash of good old capitalism thrown in for good measure.Again, it is a wonderful book. It will stay with you for a long time.	1
I saw the movie last night in a preview showing. I found it to be very charming. The best part of the movie by far is the cinematography. Tuscany and Italy in general are both places that I have never been before but just seeing this movie makes me want to go there all the more. I felt that the story line of this movie has a few holes but otherwise is very entertaining. My reccomendation would be to see this movie in a matine or wait until it comes out on video.	1
Outstanding book on my Catholic Faith. I would recommend this book to all Catholics especially in this Year Of Faith. Too many of us Catholic do not have a deep understanding of our catholic teachings. This book is a good starting point for reading more books on /about Catholic Teachings.	1
All of Tina and Nick's CD's are incredibe but this one is especially relaxing and perfect for escaping the rushed and hurried world we live in today.This CD will take you on a journey that will leave feeling calm, content and refreshed. Highly recommended.	1
How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh.	0
I am a complete Sudoku addict and am very disappointed with this book. The only reason I bought it was because I was desperate for more puzzles and it was the only one available at the store I was in. First of all, it costs $4.99 which to me, is way too much money when you can get a Kappa book for $1.99 which has better puzzles. Another thing that bugs me about this book is that some of the answer keys in the back don't match the corresponding puzzles. When I get to the difficult/Very Challenging ones in the back, sometimes I need a little help! But unfortunately, this book has quite a few errors in the answer section so when I've hit a dead end, it's over.I would recommend Kappa books from your local supermarket. This simply costs too much money for not mush quality.	0
A truly magnificent movie. Diane Lane shines in her role as Frances Mayes in this funny, sweet, enjoyable piece of great entertainment. The director makes this movie so engrossing and enjoyable that it is impossible to not be drawn into the wonderfully realized 3D characters and the brilliant played out scenes. The scenic locations help and so does the likable characters. Make no mistake... this is a magnificent movie.	1
The Lion The Witch and the Wardrobe was bad enough. But THIS effort was so bad as to be beneath commenting on. The other negative reviews have said it all for me.	0
My miniature schnauzer (11.75 years old) has congestive heart failure, and won't eat any of the prescription dog foods. So, she gets unsalted people food (ground meats, rice, oatmeal, and various baby food fruits and veggies). I wanted to be sure she got enough of the vitamins and minerals that I can't really figure out, so got these. She won't eat them (but she won't eat anything 'dog' except Charlee Bear treats), but when I crush them and put them in applesauce, she doesn't spit them out. That's a win around here these days... :/	1
If you don't like this movie there is something wrong with you. It was easy to follow, and it had the perfect mix of action, drama, and suspence. For an added bonus they threw in some sweet techno music that you have to love.	1
"Easily, the worst film of the year.Manipulative, ham-fisted, sloppy, insulting mess of a movie.Imagine some chick-flick parody in ""The Simpsons"" and you'll get pretty close (add some strange PC garbage for a good measure).Close to a bad soap opera episode.BTW I like both Diane Lane and Tuscany , but nothing can redeem this gross and pathetic caricature.I've learnt my lesson though - Audrey Wells work is to be avoided at all costs."	0
I had never heard Garbage before I listened to Version 2.0 at a listening kiosk at Tower Records, but I was immediately hooked. It's like a modernized Pretenders on steroids. I'd definitely recommend it. END	1
A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read.	1
Seller did a great job getting this to me in a timely fashion, no complaints there; however, the text within the book is terribly small, looks like someone zoomed out and then printed all the pages, they don't even fill the page normally (2 inch margins on the left and right and 3-5 inch margins on the top and bottom). Was excited to get the book, but not very excited about the print size	0
"Are you seriously trying to tell me that this is a baby? A 15 year old wouldnt even wear that slutty clothes. Nor would a 20 or 30 year old! Do you seriosly want your kids to have this toy, and start to dress just like the ""baby?"" If you do, then go ahead, waste your money and your kids life. Plus these are the most discusting and ugly looking toys i have ever seen. Someone really needs to sue the desinger of Bratz."	0
Altough the content on childbirth is descriptive (at times a bit too descriptive), the commentator/director Sheri Bayles is one of the most annoying, irritating, wanna-be-actresses that my husband and I have ever seen. Her approach to teaching by injecting humor is painful, and it took all of our strength to not plug our ears and cover our eyes to watch this woman. If you can handle obnoxious, loud and nerdy instructors, then you may enjoy this DVD. The 5 couples she works with in the instruction look bored and confused.	0
Chris Robinson should kick himself out of the band for these lyrics. A poor effort from a once wonderful band. Hang it up, lads.	0
I began using these diapers for my newborn, but was sorely disappointed to find that the diaper offered little protection for anyone holding my baby when she had a poo. Perhaps she is oddly shaped causing the diaper to fit poorly; however, she seems perfectly normal to me, so I am guessing it is the fault of the diaper. Every poo was a blow-out!	0
I really liked the story line in this movie, and I loved the fact that Richard Dean Anderson was in it as well.The only issue I have with the movie is that I would have liked to have seen Richard Dean Anderson in more of it. I think it would have been even better if he had gone with them to save the world at the end, but regardless of that I still have to give the movie 5 stars.	1
Yeah...Never Gonna Give you Up, Never Gonna let you down...! Rick Astley's two Top Chart nos. 'Together Forever' n 'Never gonna give you up' are so great that you love to see him sway on the floor dancing if you can ever grab a copy of the video! He's got the innocence, the voice and the charms. I have one of Rick's album n the video tracks but this one's the Best compilation with a mix of all numbers as I see there on the CD - indeed the Greatest Hits that hit the charts in US & UK. Its so much a soul singing of the UK singer Rick, he is superb with his vocals and all his numbers are musical, touching the heart! I specially luv 'Together forever...Never gonna give you up...Hold me in your arms and Whenver you need somebody. Never Gonna give u up has beautiful words and heart warming and the way he repeats Never gonna give...never gonna give....is so lovely to listen - Greatest Hits sure is a pick! Listen n enjoy!	1
Very disappointed with this one .Try their CDs Dark Passion Play and Once .They get five stars from me .	0
As someone who likes literature I must say this book is one of the most enjoyable book I've evr read. I analyzed this novel as a realistic one but it's not so gray as most of realistic stories I've read. it has all the emotions 445 pages you can cry be afraid to luagh and to just be happy from reading the book. the main charactor- Francy- She is a wonderfull girl with a lot of imagination and very smart and good I also liked the grandmother - Marry Romely wich is the symbole of the idea that you don't have know reading and writting in order to be smart. she is very good and too smart I know many people who studied in the university but still not as smart as she does.	1
"This volume is a compilation of ballads taken from albums Joe Henderson recorded in the period 1992 to 1997. The music is supurb - Henderson almost whispers through his saxophone - and provides the perfect setting for a pleasant evening. Those who seek a late night CD look no further! Those who wish to explore Henderson's work of the nineties in more detail should consider buying (one of) the albums used for this compilation: ""Lush Life"", ""So Near, So Far"", ""Double Rainbow"", or ""Porgy & Bess""."	1
I thought it was an amazing very well put together book. I really enjoyed it the whole way through not one problem	1
I picked up Into the Wilderness by accident and thought it was one of the best books I'd read. I counted the days til Dawn on a Distant Shore was released but found it to be, at best, disappointing. Truth be told, I found the story farfetched, the characters(who seemed so alive in Into the Wilderness) flat and, in some instances, just plain unlikeable, and the sea voyage boring. Absolutely nothing in this book caught my interest . . . strange, because I found the first book captivating both in terms of the developing storyline between Elizabeth and Nathanial and the book's historical context. I still look forward to the next installment, primarily because it's set back in Hidden Wolf where this story belongs, but I won't be counting the days until its release and I won't invest in a hardback edition.	0
If you're just getting into Queen's music, then I would avoid this album if I were you. There's a good reason Queen's popularity went down the tubes in the US, and it's called Hot Space. Hard to believe this album followed the smash hit The Game and preceded The Works, another strong album. But it did, proving that even the great rock bands slip up now and then.The best song on Hot Space is by far Under Pressure, the collaboration with David Bowie. That's the only reason this album gets 2 stars in my rating. Staying Power isn't that great, but not terrible. Body Language is awful; just a hard song to listen to. The other songs are just as bad.If you really want a Queen CD with Under Pressure on it, buy Classic Queen or one of the box sets. Avoid this album. You'll be glad you did.	0
A well-written book, and well documented. No matter what your view of the Arab-Israeli conflict, this book balances against the 99% of books that take a pro-Israel slant. I especially appreciated Khouri's calm, objective manner of discussing the issues.Is this book outdated? Heck no! What I think is interesting is that history basically never changes in the Middle East. This book is essential for any scholar of the area.	1
I have looked at quite a few of the reviews posted here. I bought this CD and have thoroughly enjoyed it. It is so refreshing to hear someone actually singing a tune instead of screaming, rythmic talking or hurling obscenities. I have a very varied taste in music and appreciate, country, pop, classical and even quite a bit of rock. This is a very mellow CD with enjoyable tunes and meaningful lyrics. I hope Clay is able to maintain his morals and his style as there are quite a few of us out here in a wide range of age groups that enjoy his music.	1
"I had an RCA mp3 player that used cards. I decided to purchase this one based on its reviews and cost. I'm not sorry. The only thing I had challenges with was transferring music from my PC and CD's to the player. I searched and searched and finally figured it out. I think Creative needs to have a picture of the software in the quick guide so people know which window is which.I love the ability to organize and listen to music using several options: genre, artist, etc.. It transfers very quickly (using a 2.0 USB hook-up) and sounds great. I'm just beginning to play with it so I'm looking forward to finding out everything I can about it. It isn't much larger/heavier than an IPOD and is very versatile (not to mention a whole lot less expansive). I also like the fact that it's a ""mini"" external hard drive so I can store large files on it if necessary."	1
Clay is simply amazing! His powerful, crystal clear voice is shown on all cuts; I have never listened to a CD where I have liked every single track on it. My favorite song keeps changing daily. This CD is every bit worth the money to buy it and more. No wonder it sold double platinum.	1
This product worked just as advertised. Inflated in less than 3 minutes, and after testing for 2 weeks, remains inflated with just minor refill of air required. Great value for the price. Highly recommended.	1
This thermometer was surprisingly inexpensive. It was very easy to install and has poven to be very helpful every day. It is unobtrusive but very easy to read; serves my purpose very well.	1
Since the final movie in the Dark Knight trilogy came out not too long ago, I decided to get myself up to speed on what had happened so far before its release. And boy am I glad I did. Christian Bale is HOT and I loved seeing him put through his paces.	1
I have just spent 5 minutes trying to get this damn printer to print an envelope without mangling it. Wonderful.	0
Though not strictly an historical piece, not a documentary, Zoot Suit shows an entertaining and engaging storyline. It does this while revealing an historical event and how it is indicative of the unequal justice of the past and present for non-whites and those not fitting the social norms set by white society. It is truly worth seeing but I have had to explain the Edward James Olmos character to several people. He is voice in Henry Reyna's head, the image of what a Zoot Suiter was seen as, narrator of the story, and a few other things all put together. See him as a shadow more than an actual character that all others can see.	1
i ordered orwells 1984 on may 27. my card was charged. i did not recieve book. where do i go for a refund? steve	0
This book was one I read in sixth grade and it was dull and slow. Not great and I usually love books about witches for I am very interested in the topic and it is not unusual for I live in Massachusettts and as you know in Salem, Massachusetts was where they hanged witches. But the one flaw in this book was that it was dull and barely talked about Kit meeting up with the witch of blackbird pond and just told about her life basically from the barbadoes and her coming to Conneticut. Second of all the biggest flaw in this book is that the witch hunt took place in Conneticut! Uh! Uh! I don't think so. Conneticut is definetly not a setting for a witch hunt. That is definetly Massachusetts. You may have heard of witch hunts in Conneticut but a few and Massachusetts is of course the homeland for witch hunts in New England. Sorry Elizabeth George Speare but get your history right!	0
This desk is really pretty. It is a good size, but not overly big in the room. I learned from other reviews that the chair is included with this desk purchase, and not to order the chair separately. I also ordered the matching 3-shelf bookcase, which is a slightly different shade of white, but nothing too noticeable--especially since they aren't by each other. We rubbed beeswax on the bottom of the drawer so it slides more easily. I would recommend this to anyone who doesn't want to spend a fortune, but still wants something that looks nice.	1
I purchased this book with great expectations. It is richly illustrated with rare photographs of obsolete aircraft soldiering on in an important area of operations. The writing and research was excellent, which I have come to expect from Mr. Hagedorn. However, one of these rare photographs depicted a nude strip-club dancer. Others depicted aircraft with explicit 'nose art'. When I read a military history book, it is my expectation that I (or my son) will not be subjected to objectionable photos. I returned the book for a refund. Sorry Dan.	0
Personally I thought this book was dried out and boring. I had to read this book for my English class and I did not enjoy it. It seemed like it took 50 pages to tell about how the character was hungery. I am no expert in novels, but I have read plenty of more enjoyable and worthwhile books. On a good note, there was a lot of interesting facts on whaling, sailing, and survival. I probably enjoyed learning all the facts more than the storyline itself.	0
I loved this book! This is one of those stories that I really hated to see end. The characters had wonderful personalities and I found myself laughing out loud quite often. I would love to see a sequel with Ramsey & Brigid & bring all of the original characters back!	1
I was excited to receive this book. I am a red head and have an infant son with red hair too. This book was very boring. I hung in there hoping it would get better but soon found myself skipping pages. It did not hold my interest and didn't seem to make much sense. I have a red headed girlfriend that I was going to pass it on to but after reading it I have changed my mind. The cover is attractive so therefore it makes a good coffee table book.	0
I love these converses, the only problem is I used the size guide and ordered a 7 which is supposed to be a uk 5 europe 38, however I got a massive size 40 (7) and they don't fit. Also I now live in London and can't return them. sad times :(	0
I bought this book for my friend Lorna for all she has done for me and she got a kick out of it	1
This version of tango is not argentine. It is ballroom latin american whatever you call it. Very misleading to call it argentine tango. But if you like ballroom dancing, maybe this video is for you.	0
These comments are for the Freddie Jones reading of Hound for Penguin Audiobooks. It's abridged -- the packaging doesn't make this clear; it's in fine print on the back. However -- it's a very good abridgement; unless you know the story practically line by line, the cuts are very unobtrusive. My advice is have a copy of the print version, and listen to this one in the car or at bedtime, knowing it isn't complete. Freddie Jones gives it a very good reading, absolutely drenched in Victorian gothic atmosphere. I would recommend it.	1
See this move for Matt Schue. I think that is his name. If it is the long haired blonde dude. He is so hot.	0
I needed this in a timely manner to replace the department video that had been misplaced. I ordered it the day before Thanksgiving, and it was shipped out to me the Friday after. It arrived in good condition in plenty of time for me to review before using it in the class room.	1
ATI used to forfeit the driver quality game to nVidia, but with the 8500, things seemed to have changed for the better.This is the card to get if you can't afford Nvidia's Geforce4 Ti 4600 or can't find Geforce4 Ti 4200 in stock (as was the case when I bought this card).	1
"We actually got this crinkle book as a gift from a Disney set (from Sam's Club, I think) and our son LOVED it as a baby. It was one of two toys we always gave him when he was in the car seat. When he was really young (3-6 months or so) we would hang it from the car seat handle, and now that he's older (6-13 months), we just hand it to him. We just love hearing the ""crinkle crinkle"" from the back seat when we're out and about. He plays with it and chews on it and it still looks almost brand new. I agree with another reviewer that it's more of a toy than a book, but I still can't wait for him to be able to read it! I highly recommend this book."	1
I bought a Canon SX230HS camera for a European vacation.It has excellent reviews but battery life is one area where it's been criticized so I decided to purchase a backup before leaving. I decided against a generic battery after reading that although they're cheaper, they don't hold as good of a charge as a Canon. I purchased one from ANATOLIAN BOOKSTORE, INC. through Amazon because that was the best price I found and I was very pleased that the battery was indeed an authentic Canon and holds the same charge as the one that came with the camera.It was delivered promptly, at a good price and was as advertised. I would buy from this vendor again.	1
i think this book was a very good book. it is a good book for young teens/adults should read before they go out and do something like partying or drinking underage without thinking first.and hopefully they will think before doing things. over all it was a great book and i would read it again. i recomend this book to young adults, and hope that everyone else who reads it too likes it.	1
it doesn't get hot enough and has much less wattage than my old one. Where can I find one a better one???	0
I wish I hadn't spent the money . . .It follows in the same style as the other two Transformers movies, but it turns the formula up a bit. There's more action and more bickering between characters, but plot, story and character development, drama, and any semblance of intelligence are sacrificed for it.Yes, the special effects are cool, but the dialog and interaction between characters is downright painful, which kept suspension of disbelief from kicking in.If I had it to do over again, I'd rent this one.	0
"This play is so much fun, but you wouldn't know it from this static, phoned-in production. There are some good actors here, but it feels as if someone said, ""You're acting in film, so just pull it way back."" Dull, lifeless. Find the very fun 1968 RSC film version directed by Peter Hall (also with Mirren, but this time as Hermia) and see that instead.Beware: Several reviews here of this version are from reviewers who didn't watch it, but saw Mirren's name, and assumed it to be their beloved 1968 RSC production. It's not."	0
I saw this movie at the UMFF. It was toooo long. It was into 67 mins and still haven't got to the point. The storylines ...well so are all over the place. I would recommend putting on this movie if you have insomia. Trust me it will put you to sleep	0
This radiator seems to be very cheaply built. Its aluminum and plastic! It did not even come with a radiator cap. How cheap can you get?	0
As is the custom of Barth, this book is informative but incredibly boring. The story of the Basseri is detailed and interesting but Barth has a style all his own and to say the least it is not engaging.	0
Well let's start with Alagna's darkened voice. I think Roberto may be developing Carreras-Itis. This is cartainly a different sounding Roberto Alagna that I have ever heard. His middle is muddy and his top doesn't ring like in the past. I like the selection of songs including a song he wrote for this album. Not all the arrangements are tradtional (some even being on the ridiculous side) and maybe this makes his efforts a little tainted. In the liner notes Roberto comments on his approach to some of the songs. He admits he tries to sound like a pop singer (i.e. White Christmas-what a butcher job). On other songs he was a tenor. Even that doesn't add up to much. Tenor fans and Alagna fans will be very disappointed with his singing. I was. This album will let him iclude himself as one of the elading tenors in the post Domingo/Pavarotti/ and Carreras era. His Sacred Aria album is much better than this one.	0
DON'T LISTEN TO WHAT ANYBODY SAYS! This album is such a letdown after the first. Even their b-sides are better than this! Ugh! This is the perfect example of a band that reahces their haitus, and figures no matter what they do people will buy into it any way, so they make a horrible album. This album is like Nonpoints Development letdown after their groundbreaking Statement. Bad stuff. Keep away from this cliche trendy little cop-out band.	0
This are the first three books in the Halo series and are great. The first one reveals how Master Chief became Master Chief, his training and his first missions are revealed in this book. The second book is a book of Halo: Combat Evolved, it tells what happens with Master Chief and with everyone in the Pillar of Authum then they arrive to the first Halo, Installation 04. The third book reveals what happens between Halo: Combat Evolved and Halo 2. If you like science fiction books, this is for you, and if you consider yourself a Halo fan, you MUST read this books.	1
Never received this item and no response when I emailed this person. I have put in for a refund.Laurie	0
Whoever cast this movie sure made a big mistake choosing Jennifer Love Hewitt. She might play a sweet teen but sure couldn't fill the shoes of Audrey Hepburn. She looked like a child playing dress up. This little girl obviously didn't do her homework. She never captured Audrey's elegance and free spirit. It would take a very special person to play such an extroadinary person like Audrey Hepburn. Actually I think they should have found an unknown that would have brought a fresh look into the the life of Audrey Hepburn. Even the character that played Capote didn't convince me. I felt the movie as a whole looked as though it was thrown together which made me bored with the whole process. I felt nothing. Since Audrey Hepburn was a big screen movie star this movie should have been made for the big screen not T.V.	0
A bad idea?I agree with Kireviewer, if you care about the music, it's hard to get past the dumb opening, a host who even Will Rodgers couldn't like, a set apparently built in a high school shop class, and the many annoying interruptions. They took a too short concert, and turned it into a bad, too long music video. I guess the mindless filler was necessary to get the length up to the claimed 1 hour. The music is OK, but it was neither the band's best period, nor their best work.	0
man you indonesian cats are geniuses i totally agree. Ive already told me friends your message and i have sent countless emails voicing our argument. NEVER BUY ANY WUTANG CLAN ALBUMS AGAIN!!!!!we want our 36 chambers back!!!!!	0
In this unique conbination of biography, commentary, & devotional, Arthur Pink offers an intimate view of the many sides of David. The shepherd, the soldier, the king and the sinner are revealed in a way that cuts to the heart of life's greatest problems.	1
Batman has obtained cult status with all ages. And of course I am a fan of the big black bat and own all the other movies.Actionwise this movie is fantastic. The special effects in the battles are very good. I have seldomly seen better. The only thing that bothers me about this movie is that there are some changes in the storyline which have already been explained in the earlier episodes. I think that takes a lot of the realism away. For instance some parts of the beginning of batman have been changed, where little bruce see's his parents die, which was a main part of the movie with the Joker. But I don't want to kill the suspense.I really think this movie is worth watching and I am glad that I got it. I definetly recommend it for any Batman fans.	1
THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world.	1
I had high hopes for this game since I'm a big Tolkien fan and really like good GBA RPGs. Boy, was I disappointed! First off the game is horribly slow. Combat takes forever, and is boring since your character miss all the time. You'll spend hours walking around looking for mundane items like flowers or Pippen.Add to that fact that the game is horribly buggy. Gimli turns invisible in one quest, sometimes the elves don't give you items you need, and I've yet to meet anyone online who found a way out of Moria without the game crashing.Don't buy this waste of a game. Save your money and either wait for one of the other Lord of the Rings games coming out this Christmas (The Two Towers) or buy Golden Sun or Castlevania instead. This is a prime example of a great license going to waste.	0
"This book did give the reader some very interesting facts and folk lore about archaeological discoveries that could prove the existence of superior ""giant"" races in the Americas. The only thing I did not like about the book (except for the grammatical errors), was that the author would mention some dramatic event (such as the discovery of giants' bones in a mound) and leave the reader hanging after a couple of paragraphs about the find. This book could have easily been an entire set of volumes, should everything have been explained in detail. Overall, it was a very interesting book leaving the reader wanting to know more about certain discoveries and theories within the book."	1
I purchased the paperback version instead of the Kindle version because it was $5 less from Amazon. That is the reason for removing one star. I have just started reading the book and appears to be worth the read hence the 4 stars.	1
No one in this film would ever win an academy award for anything, no would the film itself. That aside, you'd have to look long and hard to find a film with more T&A (good stuff) than this ones got. The movie itself and the dumb plot are childishly enjoyable. One of the most hillarious elements is the carwash owner who seems to be immune to any type of testosterone attacks despite the fact that he's got scantily clad(or not!) women running around all over the place waiting for the chance to have sex! One hillarious film.	1
A little hard to figure out how to put on the car at first, but I love it otherwise. Holds bikes well above the road and is easy to take off and put on once you get past the initial set up. Also, this thing does not move at all after it's all cinched down. The bike stays exactly where you put it and you don't have to worry about it shifting while you're driving.	1
Batman Begins is freakin awesome...but there are technical flaws with the two-disc edition. The second disc has the copyright infringment notice and the WB logo, and nothing else. There are a few reviews siting this same problem, but I had Amazon to send me another copy only to find the same problem with this one too. There seems to be a conspiracy afoot!!	0
This vest in very cool. Looks nice and is comfortable to wear. Lots of pockest for all sorts of stuff. Also has several velcro and button spots available for expanding and cusotmizing.	1
Been using this printer for about 6 months and love it. Got tired of replacing the color ink cartriges in inkjet printers to make them print monochrome. This printer is a lot faster than inkjets anyway, both warmup and print speed. Ink cost works out just over 3 cents a copy using HP toner cartriges. Had no trouble setting up on XP desktop.	1
"1984 is written in the style of the ""negative utopia."" It is a dark vision of a future society in which personal freedom has been destroyed and in which a small group have established dictatorial control over the many. It was written mainly as a warning against authoritarianism and totalitarianism.....not just the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany, but also against the totalitarianism of the mind that is currently evolving in capitalist culture as well. Orwell was a socialist. This is only relevant to counter those who say that Orwell was criticizing socialism. He most certainly was not...socialists stand for personal freedom and economic democracy.This is a very well written book with a good plot. Orwell's vision was a clear one and a danger that has not entirely been eliminated today."	1
I was very disappointed with this. It barely keeps my mug of coffee warm - barely luke warm for that matter. I don't recommend this product.	0

"Wow..thats basically all i can say. I bought the cd, then realized that they were playin live like 20 minutes from my house. They put on an amazing show! They closed it with do you call my name, then went backstage. The crowd started chanting, ""ONE MORE SONG!!"" The drummer came out and started playing again. Then all the rest came back out and played one last song. Ra is underrated and a great bunch of guys. I got my cd autographed by all 4 and i got a picture with them. Buy From One, Duality, and SEE THEM LIVE!! My ears are still ringing."	1
"I gave this CD five stars because of Clays incredible voice. I will concede the fact that the production and the song choices could have been better. Nevertheless, Clays voice is so AMAZING that any shortfalls in the production and material is easily offset with Clays musical prowess. There are however, some excellent songs on this CD, such as The Way, Perfect Day, Measure of a Man and Shine.DONT LISTEN TO THE CLAY HATERS THAT COME HERE ON AMAZON AND GIVE THIS CD ONLY ONE STAR! Those people are just haters of good music and they are trying to persuade you not to buy this CD. Also, granted some of the five star reviews may be from ""Claymates"" but that does not negate the fact that this CD is really good.BUY THIS CD! It is entertaining and fun. Isn't that why we all buy CD's, to be entertained?"	1
this toy looks really cool, but i think they should make it have better graphics and a better screen.	1
Although many people think that reading such books as these, the accounts of teenagers who died while under the Nazi regime, is depressing...people should tell them, it should be. This book was very good, and I read it a few years ago during a class that I had to take. Everyone had read the Diary of Anne Frank, but although this includes excerpts of hers, I was interested to know what others thought. Whether or not they were as optimistic as she was. If you are looking for a read that will give you different perspectives on how teenagers thought about the Holocaust, this is the book for you.	1
The persons responsible for the concept and production of this recording should not be let loose in a recording studio again. That Christy Baron should acquiese to such drivel is beyond comprehension. That Chesky Records would allow it to be released should be a felony.C'mon. Electronics, sampling, throat singing? Were any gimmicks spared on this production?	0
With the rubber ring in place the head set does not seat well in the gels and comes out too easily. With the ring off it will barely stay in the small size. The medium gels fit me best until they are stretched by the rubber ring. One gel even split wen trying to put the earpiece back in. I am trying the small for now until I find a better solution.	0
High quality, light weight and uniquely interesting pattern. Adds fun to the dining experience and cleans up like a dream in the dishwasher. Arrived in absolutely perfect condition and was packaged exceptionally well.	1
This is a classic for sure but a classic of what? Most of the people Harrington writes about have created their own worlds and then populated them. Yes, we do feel sorry for the underprivileged but most people in America have the privilege of a free education, free libraries and free charity. If they fail, whose fault is it?	1
Only Kate from London got it right about the character played by Julie Waters. One reviewer stated that she was a cockney, and the other said she was a London housewife.Of course she was a Liverpudlian; one who is from Liverpool.The character would not have been nearly as funny had she been from any other place. The accent and Liverpool attitude is what makes this film work so well.One of my favorite movies. Have watched it about eight times over the years. It never looses its luster.	1
One sunday afternoon, I sat down to watch this movie with my girlfriend, and sat back awaiting stimulating entertainment.... HOW WRONG COULD I BE!What a complete load of utter complete inane useless rubbish this movie is...it is only funny if you are over 60 and like to sit in a cinema in a sleeping bag discussing being an old aged lesbian with nothing better to do than watch drivel with no point and a plot as predicatble as a an predicatble thing in a very predicatble place!I will not even offer this for re-sale, as I am so looking forward to destroying it in the most imaginative way possible....any ideas???	0
It's the way things happen, not the pizzazzy prose or the dialogue, that sets Charlie up to be read by every high school student alive. While not hideously exciting to the modern reader, there is a lot to be gleaned from this compassionate narrative about the unhumanness of the modern world.	1
There is no one experience that could somehow describe them all. I didn't find the book very interesting, nor would I recommend it as reading for those who are going to go on the JET Programme sometime in the future. In fact, I recommend you read very little of the 'foreigner does Japan' genre and stick with facts, figures and Japanese language. And basics of English language teaching. Believe me, you will enjoy your 1-3 years in isolation and miscommunication without your head full of pop-anthropological nonsense and you will come to know your full self.	0
The book has good illustrations and it has the song five times. The illustrations go very nicely with the words to the song.	1
"Some nights when I leave work for the day I look into the night and always feel so much better when I discover there is a full moon. I feel the same way about the music of Jennifer Warnes. I'm glad to know it's there. Jennifer and her beautiful voice has been such an inspiration to me over the years. I am truly glad that this collection includes her early work. Jennifer's music will stand the test of time, i.e. 20 or 30 years from now people will still be listening to the music of Jennifer Warnes. But you don't have to wait that long. Buy this great collection of songs and give your heart a treat! After all to quote a Jennifer Warnes song ""all we have is here and now"". So buy it!"	1
We are very happy with pampers! They fit our daughter well and we hardly ever have a leak. When we do have a leak it's been at night when she has slept extra long. We also love the pampers rewards :)	1
These were way to expensive and I cannot believe that I bought these. You might as well as get a piece of tape and try to use that. It will be just as effective. Which means not at all. go with sally hansens. do not buy from here.	0
"Loved Cher's acting and Vikki Carr's #1 song""It Must Be Him"" Whoever picked Vikki's songfor the movie/video knows classy music from a internationalsuperstar. Hopefully, we will hear more on Vikki Carr.Heard they mention Vikki again in ""Vanilla Sky"" too!"	1

"This is one movie I would watch over and over again. The story is great. the suspense is great without alot of blood and guts. As it says in the movie"" makes a great bedtime story""."	1
I think TUSCAN SUN is a study in what is so wonderful about the Tuscany and Cinque Terra part of Italy.....Diane Lane is a favorite of mine. Ever since I saw her in COTTON CLUB I have liked her. I guess in some minds the story could be conjured up as a chick flick. And why? because she gets a divorce from a guy who apparently is having a midlife crisis??? or is it because she packs up and heads off on a gay holiday provided by two lesbian friends?...But this is how she finds the abode of her dreams!.....Actually more like a nightmare.I think it is a film that deserves the accolades it has gotten, but not because it would only be appreciated by 'chicks', but by anyone who loves Tuscany the way I do.The cast of characters in TUSCAN SUN was a study in why I love to sit and watch the parade go by when I travel. It is one of the facinating parts of travel for me.....locales are not the only thing exotic about it all.	1
Very catchy, ambitious and intelligent lyrics. This guys are awesome, with tight musicianship and perfect vocals. My version is without de DVD, and i'm a little dissapointed about that, just for this. Recommended if you like Gamma Ray and Primal Fear.	1
State of Play kept my attention every step of the way with well developed characters, action, and layered plot. It's one of the best dramas that I've ever seen on TV. Each turn and twist; each relationship; politics, journalism, or love interest keeps you guessing the next step. Great writing and great acting put this series at the top. Loved it!	1
Personally, I enjoy novels in which I can relax. 1984 let me do anything but that. Not only is the book overly detailed, but quite borring. Unless it's assigned, I wouldn't suggest it.	0
"I first saw this ad before Christmas, and decided to check back later. I have checked 7 times since then and the glasses are never in stock, but I should ""Get in line""?I don't shop at Amazon in order to be ""in line"" for 2 months.Does this stuff exist or is simply a method to get you ""on the line""?"	0
This is amazing, all predictions and foreshadows came true in our present day lives. Amazing story a must read.	1
The lights that I received are absolutely not as pictured. The product description is vague if not poor.The lights received are much smaller than in the photo (an inch in diameter). They are useless as illumination. I live in a high-sun area and have placed the charger in a position where it gets sun from dawn to dusk. The cord from the charger and the lights is long, which allows you to place the charger on the roof. In the end they are not worth the price.	0
Deceptive, this is a book with a strong religious content. It assumes the reader has a strong reliance in God to solve his/her anger issues.	0
Anyone who wants to know a little bit more about Beatrix Potter, the person, will be pleased with this book. Through real-life annecdotes John Heelis conveys what should be obvious but isn't - Beatrix Potter was not a perfect human being, she had tiny flaws just like the rest of us. Sometimes she got cranky, occasionally she was absent-minded with her head in the clouds but mostly she was wonderful - although quite strong willed and opinionated.Those who are fascinated by Beatrix Potter will find the little book a great addition to their library. However, be forewarned - those who are buying this book for a voyeristic look into the intimate details of Beatrix Potter's married life will be sorely disappointed. This very private woman's private life remains private.	1
This item works great.I used it on an old windows 98 machine. Worked right out of the box. The antenna wire could be a little longer. It replaced a linksys USB I never could get to work right.	1
"I love historical fiction like the Hornblower series, the O'Brian books, and more recent gems like ""The Triumph and the Glory"". C.S. Forester has written another spellbinding novel in ""Lieutenant Hornblower"", I highly recommend it."	1
One Hundred Years of Solitude is one of the most fascinating books I have ever read ( and I have read thousands).Marquez is a giant. His skill is like that of a mythical creature, like a Phoenix combined with a hundred great authors.The pure fact that this book was written by one man is amazing. I don't want to say anything about the story. If you care about great literature, do not let life pass by without reading Marquez' masterpiece.	1
I don't think Golding quite got the hang of the early humans he was using as his subjects! There is far more to them and far more interesting and exciting things about them that simply were missing in his story. Not a bad read, but did not come up to my expectations!	0
"A lot of work clearly went into this book, but not a lot of information. If you're looking for info, some of the web references are the wrong addresses, the book is about 220 pages (double spaced) with about 100 pages that are reprints of ""checklists"" - i.e., does your child prefer to be warm or cool when studying? There are references to other people's work (admittedly there's not a lot out there) but it seems only anecdotal original work, most of which is repeated numerous times and is generally the same girl identical twins. For those of you out there looking for answers, they're not in this book."	0
I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch.	0
Wouldn't it have been nice if the _not_ Kurt had gone with Kim Gordon? He could've been a member of the family. How cool would that be to have Kim Gordon and Thurston Moore as parents?

"I grew up in New England and have visited Nantucket on many occasions. After reading this book my last visit to the whaling museum gave the whalejaws, the harpoons, the whaleboats and other artifacts new meaning.Whaling was an extraordinarily demanding and dangerous endeavor even when the whales were ""well-behaved."" In this story, we have the drama of the Moby Dick theme coupled with a survival story that is amazing in and of itself.I found the writing excellent and the story well told. If readers have a chance to visit a whaling museum it will give the read a bit of an extra punch."	1
Carmen Depalma, a Houston detective, searches for a bizare serial killer. The search leads her into the world of bi-sexual women and sado-masochism.I liked this book for the first hundred pages. It seemed like a good murder/suspense tale was in the making. About page 200 I began to wish the action would speed up; at page 300 -- with 200 pages yet to traverse -- I gave up. I won't read a book that bores me.A good editor would have chopped out most of the author's lengthy descriptions of odd sexual practices and societies of bi-sexual women and cut this book down to 300 pages. With a little more discipline and a lot of cutting the author might have produced a good thriller.Smallchief	0
"Tom Brokaw's book is an evaluation of those he interviewed, much like the news he reports each night - detailed and personal. For those Marines who want a look at the same information, but just about the enlisted man of the Corps during that period, a comparable book is ""Gyrene"" written by Wilbur Jones, and published by White Mane Press."	0

In the beginning, William is an ordinary boy, but when his toy knight comes alive, and William shrinks, the adventure begins. This book was one of the best books I've ever read. And anyone with a big imagination and a love for adventures will love this book too.	1
"I love legos, but his was a little disappointing. The roof tiles are wider than the ""normal"" lego tiles that come with other kits, so you can't combine the sets. The reason I got this set was to create bigger houses, but I still can't since the tiles don't match my other tiles. Not sure why. As for the windows and doors, they are great."	0
Let me preface my review by stating that this is my first Kathy Reichs book. It will most likely be my last. I felt as though I was reading a CSI book written by Tom Clancy - way too technical. However, that may be the audience for which she is writing.The first 2/3rds of the book was dull, slow, boring and disconnected. As Ms. Reichs builds to the climatic end, I felt as though it suddenly jumped to 120 mph which did not lend itself the ability for the reader to get a mind picture of what was happening.If you like technical writings (sometimes even in foreign languages), this is the book for you. If you are looking for an entertaining mystery to read, I would suggest you look else where.	0
With this being his first attempt It is very good for a new commer. Let us hope he has more input and more display of his wonderful voice in next CD:)Anita	1
I absolutely love this movie. From beginning to end you can't look away. It starts off sweet and as it moves along it gets creepier and scarier. Poor Rosemary. Definetely a must see for horror movie fans.	1
With only owning the Crowes first 2, and what some would call their best albums, I was anxious to get By Your Side. It was only more recently that I learned this album was a forced studio effort. It seems, at times, tight and forced, but the true talent of the Crowes shows through. Even under the... supervision of their record company the Crowes add their personal rock n' roll touch and attitude.. Songs like Go Faster, By Your Side, Horsehead, Only A Fool, Go Tell The Congregation and Virtue and Vice will be classic rock songs. In a decade were manufactured teen pop ruled the scene and record companies were trying to make carbon copies, the Crowes keep a breaming rock generation alive.	1
Screaming? More like being strangled. How could they possibly have played that back and decided it was a good idea? Pity, because otherwise the mixture of good girl vocals and hard chunky guitars, combined with good hooks in the songwriting department is very pleasing to the ears. And then . . . they decide to put a plastic bag over her head and mic her yelling. Bizarre; almost every track starts out compelling and becomes unlistenable to the point of being laughable.	0
Basically, if you ever played mario on the N64, you know what this game is going to be like. It's the same type of scenario where you do various things in each level to achieve stars (or hearts in the case of this game). The graphics are cool, but I just became bored due to the dejavue factor. I was dissapointed.	0

There are a few things I didn't like about the tape. Firstly, the price is too high. Secondly tape is inconvenient for a spoiled by technology user. It's much easier to work with DVDs and their menus. And lastly, I realized that I'd rather spend 70 dollars on 4 monthly group lessons and learn basic steps and routines of one dance then try to master all by myself while watching a tape.	0
This is simply the best R. Kelly. I don't care what lot of people think of 12 Play but this one beats it with no competiton. Chocolate Factory is hot too, but does not strike it like this one does.

This action packed book was filled with laughs, and tears. George Milton and Lennie Smalls are best friends. They have been working together for life, and one day plan to have a little house with crops and animals. They both go to work on another farm, and it seems to be working out for them, so that one day their dream can come true. But then Lennie gets into big trouble that costs two peoples lives and affects many others.	1
"Diapers are one baby expense you don't want to cut corners on -- i tried two different cheaper ""store brands"" and found they differ from Pampers in three key areas: thickness, fit and absorbancy. Pampers are very thin, meaning you can get more of them in the diaper bag, and it's easier for baby to move in them. They fit well, especially around the outside of the thigh, where leakage is most likely to occur. The absorbancy is far superior to off-brand diapers -- they don't balloon up and leak until they are VERY full. With the Amazon mail option, they are much cheaper than I can get in my local stores, even with coupons, and home delivery is wonderfully convenient."	1
Clay has a horrible voice (sorry obsessed Claymates,it's true) and this cd proves it. All the songs are generic and unoriginal, he brings nothing new to the music industry. His voice is so irritating and grating. A year from now (or not even) he will be forgotten.	0

I bought this dress in white for my informal shotgun wedding ceremony at City Hall. I am typically a 16/18W and I bought a 2X in this dress.(I have more of an hourglass figure with wider hips and a smaller waist). The dress fits true to size and looks very flattering. Also, I am 5'9 and the dress hits just below my knee. I love the satin finish and matching shawl that comes with it. I do have to get the top tailored slightly because it's too big for my 38C size. Other than that it's perfect for my event!	1

Clever acting...and just superb! Now...when is this movie going to be on DVD?????	1
If you love meaningless running around, plot lines thatdefy even sympathetic attempts to suspend disbelief, andsnarled bureacratic conflicts among different law enforcement agencies, you might put up with this one. Otherwise . . . the book disappoints. One gets the impression that it was written in haste. A pale imitation of the previous work . . .deserves to be piled high on the remainder tables (if not in a Potter's Field for books).	0
The whole transaction went smoothly. Arrived within reasonable amount of time however have not had the time to watch the movie yet!	1
Okay, let's be objective, A NEW DAY HAS COME was a fine album, ONE HEART was simply the crappiest Celine album ever, but now she brings us this piece of art for those who appreciate her french music .. her roots. This album was targeted mainly for french and Canadian people, but it's topping the charts all over Europe, because of its quality!It is a musical piece of art which combines folk with blues and some irish shades. With tremendous guitar arrangements played by the amazing Gildas Arzel each song turns into a living nostalgia.Her voice is relaxed as it's never been, and she doesn't try to force it to hit high notes.. she just sings with her heart.even if u don't speak french, u'll love this album for its musicality!!!!!!!!! GO AND BUY IT -WON'T REGRET	1
This book is great for little active hands. Its a Pop-up kind of thing (the moving parts of pop-ups, not the actual 3D stuff) all made of thick card board so its pretty indestructable. That is, except for the cover. I'm not sure what they were thinking. Its a single piece of cardboard, flimsier than cereal box cardboard. I'm not sure why they did that, especially since the reverse of the cover is the first page of the book. The rest of the pages (and back cover) are all thicker than even the sturdiest boardbook. I still give it a solid rating though - sometimes you just have to wonder what people are thinking.	1
I like the item but was misled there is no license plate holder. It is just a the adapter and you have to add a license plate holder. Otherwise you can just bolt on the license plate from the bottom. WORKS!	1
"The author covers a great deal on commands and syntax, but the true strength of this title lies in its ability impart an understanding of the logic and numerous concepts behind PHP/MySQL development. I would most recommend this book to those individuals who are comfortable with HTML and CSS, and have at least minimal programming experience. Sharp and dedicated ""no-experience"" beginners could probably figure things out as they go along, but it would require some effort. I personally think that's a fair trade for a book that will prove itself invaluable to anyone seriously interested in learning PHP/MySQL development."	1
DO NOT GET THIS VERSION. It is a scam. Literally. It contains acts 1 and two, and then skips right to act 5. The text has obviously been copied and pasted from various sources, it randomly switches between paragraph form and iambic pentameter.The image on the front and back is pixel-y, someone with little knowledge of image editing applied it.This isn't even a good forgery. I could tell something was wrong the moment I picked it up.	0
_Heroes of Civilization_ is Cottler and Jaffe's attempt to give brief biographical sketches of some of the most important scientists of the last few centuries. Their stories are of course somewhat dated now, but they still capture the thrill and charm of scientific discovery. PAsteur and Robert Koch are among those profiled. Appropriate for children.	1
"I saved my job by reading this book. One of my co-workers and I were having a difficult time getting along. I loved my job, but this friction between the two of us was really starting to bug me and although the job market is tight right now, I had decided to float my resume around and see what was out there.BUt, I went to the bookstore and saw CRUCIAL CONFRONTATIONS. It had so much great advice on how to deal with confrontation in a positive way. By using the books advice, I was able to ""confront"" my co-worker and I realized we really were not that far apart in opinions...we just expressed them differently. It would be a stretch to say that we will be best friends, but I do think we have reached a common ground and I no longer feel the need to leave my job.Go buy this book if you are have difficulty in your job. marriage or family...It is worth every penny."	1
Bill Engvall hosts this show and says he might be out of a job now that these guys are around. Your job is very, very safe Bill.

"During the run of ""American Idol,"" I was just like most of you--riveted to the show week after week because of Clay Aiken's astonishing voice. On the show, he sang and excelled in a variety of musical genres. However, on ""Measure of a Man,"" the producers have done Clay a disservice by giving him only mediocre ballads to sing. I kept hoping for at least one uptempo song--or funky song--or even funny song, to display Clay's amazing range and playful personality. I guess I'll have to wait for a concert DVD to get a full-fledged dose of Clay to rival his AI performances, because this CD doesn't deliver."	0
Les Annees BechetLike another reviewer, I was turned on to Sidney Bechet by Woody Allen's Paris at Midnight, which used Bechet for the opening and closing titles. I ended upbuying essentially every Bechet CD I could find on Amazon. In my judgement this one is the best not only by containing the Paris at Midnight theme but other great numbers. Bechet's September Song is truly great.	1
I can say that this a bad anime.the animation quality is average and the story is dull from start to finish.There isnt any heat or excitement and it doent have a real ending.	0
I have personally used this edition of the Psalms for quite a while. Because I enjoy it so much I have purchased several copies for friends	1
I love this movie! It was very funny, yet sweet and touching. Altough the ending was a bit shocking to me,I'll be first in line to buy it when it comes out. Adam and Drew work great together. Hawaii is beautiful, the soundtrack rocks, and this movie is awesom! GO SEE IT!! GO NOW!!	1
"I read the reviews on the Internet the same way you are reading now. When I went to the store I have been misled by the salesman. He told me that the creative is a great brand and no one returned the product so far. He told me "" if it was a bad product creative would have taken it of the shelf by now"". I bought the product and it stop working after TWO DAYS"" not responding at all. I talked to the customer support and they ask me to send the product to them. It takes along..... time to get it back believe me I havent got the mine yet."	0
this is very cheap, broke almost right out of the package. I bought it to work with kids at church, a fun game to use with singing time. It didn't even make it 1/2 way around the room. A tooth stuck down, it wouldn't allow the mouth to stay open. My son was able to fix it by unscrewing the base and fiddling with it. So not worth the price. It's much smaller than I had expected. Very expensive for what it is. I only expect it to break again, so I am going to return it.	0
He is so talented and expressive with his face. I love his humor that is relatively clean but so dead on true.	1
Fantastic book! I was kept on the edge of my seat from beginning to end! This book is definitely going to be the start of an excellent series. The novel is based back in Venice, just around the decline of the Byzantium era. My favorite characters were without a doubt Manfred and Erik.This book is an excellent buy!	1
Best primer on stats existing. I've read it several times; my daughter read it at age 13 and both enjoyed and understood it. She's coaching her undergrad friends in college stats now, and even more importantly, analyzes news and thinks critically about it.A well-written, timeless book!	1
It's very simple and straight to the point and it helps out. Gives you straight motivation and a relastic out look.	1
"Not sure why this song was a hit.Yes, it has the hooks and the pop/r&b; arrangement. But vocally, it was the most boring delivery that I have heard from a top 10 hit song ever.Her vocal is so thin and her delivery sounds like she doesn't really believe what she`s singing.The lyrics sound sexy and flirtatous yet she bring none of that to the table.Take Kellis for example, while she may lack some vocal prowess, but she has that naughty come on vocal performance.This is to be the worst single of the year.The other one is Rhianna ""Unfaithful"" (I loved her Ponce de Replay song, but ballads are not her thing)"	0
"With the new memory cards the digital cameras take HUNDREDS of pictures which is great .... until the message ""Low Battery""! This time I remembered four days before my son's wedding that I need a spare battery! Ran to the mall, to the electronics stores, but nobody had it. The answer was "" contact the manufacturer"". There was no time for that, except AMAZON.COM. Two days later arrived to my house! That's service! Of course I was able to take thousands of pictures and save my son's wedding!"	1
I originally bout a netgear adapter because it was a little cheaper than the Tivo adapter. I had nothing but problems with the netgear. Poor signal strength (33% or less) and frequent lost connections (a few times per week on avg). I put up with it for about a year or so before deciding to try the Tivo adapter. I read some good reviews, but was still skeptical. Not any more. It worked great right out of the box, much stronger signal (90%) and after nearly one month, it hasn't lost it's network connection even once! This was definitely the way to go.	1
"Purchased this device to complete the elimination of our landline telephone. It did exactly as promised, with the added benefit of renting movies online; no more late night trips to the ""Red Box""."	1
This item is cute and sturdy. However, the seller has it listed as being 50 lb shipping weight. Mine arrived and did not even weigh 5 lbs including all the packaging material. They gave me a refund for most of my shipping and said they would change their listing. Two months later it is still saying 50 lbs. The price for this bird bath is right on with what it is worth - but the deceptive shipping makes this a bad purchase	0
"""The Witch of Blackbird Pond"" is poorly advertised. If you're expecting a novel filled with accounts of the Salem Witch Trials, like I thought, you're wrong. It is not until almost 200 pages into the book will the subject be touched upon, and then gingerly dropped. Much of the writing is fillers and dribble; this book could have been 100 pages shorter. I didn't care for any of the characters, and all of them were typecast. The angry, strict Uncle, the caring, soft-spoken Aunt, two cousins - one being the flirt and one being sweet. And, of course, the outcast niece. I was very disappointed, as I had my sights set on a captivating Salem Witch Trial book. The title is very misleading. I do not recommend."	0
My 10 year old son has enjoyed all the books in the Harriet the Spy series.	1
I went to the theater to see this movie & I thought it was great. I really liked the special effects. Now the chemistry between the actors/actresses could've been better. I reaally liked the set too. I just thought everything about the movie was great. I can't believe that people whom have seen it are giving it bad reviews.	1
"The Pampers were a great bargain for the price! I wish they actually worked closer to the ""up to 12 hours"" promise... I really wanted them to help get through the night with my 16 month old, because her diaper ends up leaking around 4 hours into it.. So I still have to continue to wake her up in the middle of the night to change her. Which sometimes can be a HORRIBLE task! I do feel that they have the best fit for the size though.. Overall, I would definitely buy this brand and this ""economy Pack"" again! Good Deal!"	1
"The story is about two gays that are looking for any job. All that time while they are looking for a place also to stay, they pass trough lots of bad and good things. They always help and got each other,""I got you, you got me""said George, one of the principal characters, and this shows de people who read this book, that when you have a friend that is passing a bad moment, you have to support him , and that is a good example for children. Also, the main theme of the story is loneliness, this also help people to trie to get lots of friends, for not being alon ein the future. Story statement by Jhon Steinbeck, is a very interesting book for all ages, who wants two know about two gays that pass unforgetable moments and that one of the two lives will end in the ranch, where they finally lived and work."	0
"You can tell the difference between this and the next. A couple of good songs, nothing spectacular. One song on this CD appears on the movie ""War"" with Jet-Li. Although I rate this with an OK, Im very tough. There's no sappy love ballads, no whiney boy songs. It's in your face, and strong."	0
In my opinion the last two foundation books, Foundation's Edge and Foundation and Earth, are alot better than the original three. Isaac Asimov's wrting style has improved, it is a very imersive series that I would recomend to any sci-fi lover. Too bad Isaac didn't write anymore foundation books after this and prelude and forward to the foundation.	1
I've been baking for more than 30 years, and I thought I did OK - as did my family. But there were a lot of answers to questions that I hadn't even known I had in the Pie and Pastry Bible, and some new techniques that really have made a difference! I'm not enthusiastic about the way the book is set up, because I have to keep flipping back and forth from the filling to the crust until I get her crust recipe memorized. There are some recipes that are quite simple, but are presented in a complicated way. However, the information is very, very complete, and there are many entertaining comments and lots of recipes for any level of training and experience. I like it - and she makes a better pie crust than I do!	1
The book was interesting to me because the author speaks about life in the Army. Some soldiers got good and bad experience during their time. The book makes comments about three diferent soldiers.	0
The author uses Enron as an example of what can happen if his strategies are implemented. Need I say more?	0
This is an excellent product at an outstanding price. It makes laserjet qualty affordable and there should be no question of whether or not it is a good value. I have recommended this to several friends who have already purchased this laser jet printer	1
Don't bother with Rosemary's Baby. Don't watch it unless you are really bored on a rainy day. The film is so slow-paced and dated; 20 minutes in to the film I was looking at my watch to see how much longer I'd have to suffer. It finally ended and I let out a long sigh of relief! It is SO boring, you'll just go crazy! Please, for the love of goodness see the infinitely superior The Exorcist instead of this turkey any day of the week.	0
This, along withThe Witches' Goddess: The Feminine Principle of Divinity, provides and excellent introduction to Wiccan concepts of divinity. Both books are well researched and as complete as can be expected given the enormity of the subject.	1
i bought this book as part of classic textbooks in semiotics studies. thin book, but basic ideas of semiotics, linguistics, and literature critique theories, by barthes.	1
I'm sorry I ever purchased this movie. Eddie Rickenbacker must be rolling over in his grave. Absolutely no relationship to reality. An insipid story line and unrealistic special effects. If you want a good WWI movie, go with All Quiet on the Western Front (with Lew Ayers) or the Blue Max (with George Peppard). Forget this drival.	0
This printer has not caused my any troubles to this date. It's a quality little printer, as all HP products tend to be. The quality is good, but not great. This is an ideal printer for the casual user at home or office. The connection is USB, so the setup was easy. This printer also works well on my home network. If you need a good quality printer at a good price, the deskjet 825c would be an excellent choice.	1
Having grown up in the former Soviet Union, as soon as I started reading the book, I could tell immediately where Orwell drew his inspiration, as well as most details of peoples' existence. Reading the book was like re-visiting my childhood, as well as refreshing my mother's and grandmother's stories of the soviet life in the 1950's, all the brainwashings, terrible living conditions, propaganda, people disappearing in the middle of the night, etc. Basically, Orwell took soviet reality of that era, and then took it a few notches up, and then twisted it some. Art imitates life, so to speak. I'm not sure why everyone credits Orwell's imagination, then. Either way, the book is extremely boring, the plot is almost non-existent, nothing is really going on, the [unlikely] love affair took half-the book to unfold, and it wasn't even worth it.	0
One of my all-time favorites in a listening history that ranges from the Beatles and Motown in the 60's to the present. I can still listen to it over and over and over...It never gets old.	1
I gave it a 1-star review because I couldn't get it to work. The Dish Network package where I live wouldn't allow me to connect with the TiVo service. Before ordering this dvr, always make sure it will work with your cable or sattelite provider.	0
I recently reread Lord of Light. It is even more incredible than I remembered. It left me wanting more though-- a book twice as long-- a sequel! There is so much left to be told-- that could have been told. I guess that's the mark of a great book. Everything that makes Zelazny great is in this book-the philosophy, the adventure, the fantasy, the science fiction, the gods and the humans evolving into higher states, corruption of power, Light and Death, and lots of engaging characters. I loved Sam of course, but Yama steals the show! Tak is great-- as is the wiley Ganesha. So many twists and turns and surprises await just when you think you see what's coming. After all the imitations, this book is still fresh and free and full of wonder.I think this must be his greatest book	1
What a crap film this is!Some films are so bad that they are funny. This isn't one of them. It's just plain bad.I have nothing more to say on the subject cept make sure that your holding a loaded gun to your head before you start watching this film.That way you can put yourself out of your misery in the fastest possible way.	0
I ordered my stroller last week and it arrived within 6 days. It only took me 3 min. to put it together. I put my Boston Terrier in it and rolled her around the house to get use to it. SHE LOVES IT AND SO DO I.I can go on longer walks now and take items with me. It rolls so smoothlyand looks great.	1
If you are a fan of the Stargate series and want to see an end to the series as a movie this is a great movie and a must see and I got this fast after ordering it.	1
"Toxicity is easily one of the best releases of the year, in any genre. System of a down has taken heavy metal and interlaced it with melody and arabic influences to create an entirely new and different sound. It is heavy metal, so the faint hearted may find it a little hard to get past the sheer heaviness of the album. Daron and Serj's lyrics are at times very direct (""Prison Song,"" ""Deer Dance,"" and definetly ""Bounce"") and at other times quite mysterious (""Toxicity,"" ""Chop Suey""). Overall, a great album. They showed heaps of promise and their excellent but occasionally poor debut, and delivered on every sliver of it. Very highly recomended. High points on the album include ""Chop Suey!"", ""Prison Song,"" ""Aerials"", and ""Shimmy."""	1
Easily the best film in the series. Tranformers: Dark of the Moom is the summer event film I have been waiting for. Perhaps the biggest surprise here is that the girl replacing Megan Fox is a much better actress. The action and set pieces, including an amazing chase scene on a freeway are incredible. The last hour set in a war-torn Chicago are some of the greatest sequences ever put to film. Shia does a terrific job being both witty and funny, but also very emotional when the time comes. Unlike the first two Transformer movies, this time it truly feels like something is at stake. While I loved the first two for what they were, this one has a more authentic story and tighter narrative. Finally a 3D movie with actually depth in the shots! Your jaw will definitely drop in certain scenes.	1
The elements of the film are well portrayed in the characters interaction. While there are some changes from the book, the film does stand on it's own.	1
I have 2 2005 Dodge pickups the factory headlights suck, I bought a pair of these for one of the trucks. I have to say they are brighter then the factory bulbs. The first bulb failed in less then a year and was replaced buy the store I purchased them from, the second bulb failed 3 years later. This truck is only driven about 3k a year it sits a lot so for me these bulbs are a waste of money.My other truck which is driven by my salesman and has many more miles on it still has the OE bulbs. I have other PIAA products and though I like them when they work I have yet to have more then 3 years of trouble free use. I understand things fail but with normal use at the cost of PIAA lights they should last more then 3 years. I'll be finding a less expensive alternative for the replacement bulbs.	0
This bike is very comfortable, works well on city streets, easy to get on and off, and looks great. It was harder to put together than I expected but I got some help and it went smoothly.	1
This CD collection is an incredibly good bargain. The quality is superb and the selections were excellent as well. I am happy I ordered this.	1
"I can't vouch for the quality of the actual DVD, because I received a blank disc. (I sent it back for a refund.) However, based on the packaging - or lack of it - I would be inclined to agree with David A. Medzorian's assessment that this is an unauthorized bootleg. There was no cover insert - just a clear plastic jewel box in which the disc was placed - and the label looked like a ""print-at-home"" job. If this is a ""print-on-demand"" DVD, that wasn't disclosed in the product description. For $19.95, I expected a professional package, and (blank DVD notwithstanding) I didn't get one.If the packaging is this skimpy, it's reasonable for me to believe Mr. Medzorian's comments on the picture quality are accurate. This is not worth your time - or your money."	0
Perhaps the larger model works well. This smaller magnetic set is tragic. The only upside is that if you're working on your grip strength, these will probably help. To get a useable amount of pepper, you'll have to squeeze 15-20 times. They feel cheap and destined for a quick trip to the trash can. Stick with a tried and true twist grinder.	0
"The fatal flaw of this video is not Bowie's performance (he is brilliant), but its inferior production quality. It appears to be a pathetically low-budget production, a pity considering that it was done by the same man, D.A. Pennebaker, who wonderfully documented Bob Dylan's 1965 British tour in ""Don't Look Back"" (1967). As it is, the sound quality of this Ziggy Stardust performance is quite poor, as if all the mics were positioned 250 yards away from the stage. Moreover, the camera work is at times annoyingly erratic and inappropriate. The whole production, strangely, reeks of amateurism. If this movie would have been made with, for example, the production quality of Led Zeppelin's ""The Song Remains the Same,"" it would be well worth watching. Unfortunately, the bizarre sight of Bowie himself in action is its only saving grace."	0

What a zen master would state in a 3-line Haiku poem, Joyce says in a 700-page book, with ever dancing, ever-changing words in an amazing, multi-levelled labyrinth, more suitable and charming to Western intellect than Oriental thought. Definitely NOT the first Joyce book to read. Life is a wake, live it or krikkit!	1
"A word of mouth film. In turn sordid, fascinating, voyeuristic and sensational. The filmmakers take the wake theme and give it a new twist. From beyond the grave, Jude Law narrates and shows a film of his friends to his friends. They are shown as cowards, cheats, petty criminals, adulterers and ultimately murderers. The end is a shocker. The acting superb, in that ""fly on the wall"" documentary style. Ray Whinstone steals most of his scenes. Check him out in Sexy Beast and Final Orders."	1
i found this cd to be quite generic. the music, to me, was bland and lifeless. equal parts rap & singing, the vocals were predominant in the mix. the music was ok, heavy and slighlty melodic but i just never got into it. music should scream through your stero and say LISTEN TO THIS but this cd failed to grab my attention.	0
Robocop 3 has to be the worst possible movie in the series. While the first and the second had great humour and quite gory action sequenses the third installment hasn't got any of the critsism against the corporate world and the plot of the movie is simply rubbish .The film is made for kids and the flying Robocop just makes you wanna cry .I gave one star just because Basil Poledouris great theme is back from the first film.	0
With respect to Alvin Schwartz, there's nothing terribly inspired about the writing, but it is a children's book and I adored it when I was young. What made these books incredible, was Stephen Gammell's artwork, of which I'm still a huge fan. I was very young when I was given these books for the first time and I would poor over the images, staring at each one. And yes, they scared me. But that was the fun! They didn't traumatize me, they just scared me in a delightful way. Releasing a new edition of this work without Gammell's art is like slapping two plain pieces of bread together and calling it a sandwich.	0
This book is pretty well written and really help you understand the materials better. This book is pretty well organized and very easy to follow. This book really helps	1
A BRILLIANT READ!!!! Easily the most exceptional book on religion, power, and politics in Colonial St. Augustine from the Florida Museum of Natural History. I found it gripping from front page to last. The way St. Augustine came alive, it was like i was really there. This is a must buy for anyone who finds American history thrilling. Genius! Robert L. Kapitzke is one of the most well versed authors of our time.	1
I'm not much on writing long reviews, but I thought this little book was worth it because it helped me. Finally, of the few books out there regarding what to expect during basic training, this book is the best and most current. I've read the other two (including Mr. Thompson's first edition) and can say with certainty this book (2nd edition) is highly informative and insightful. You can even e-mail the author for more info. The best advice, don't trust just one book or just one source for your information.I ended up not enlisting for full time service, but still considering the Reserves. I'm glad I had this book to make an informed decision.Good luck if you are going in!	1
Unfortunately I had a very bad consumer experience buying this camera. I had borrowed a ZR20 from a friend the year before and liked it, so when the ZR40 came out I wanted to buy it. I read online that some people were complaining about motor noise with this camera, but I figured I try it anyways. I bought it at Best Buy (should be called Worst Buy), and when trying it out found that it does have super bad motor noise. You can't hear it while recording - it's when you are watching a tape you recorded playback on your TV etc that you hear it. The motor noise is recorded in with your audio, so you hear a loud hummmm in the background. It was too loud for me to live with. If I was recording something with no background noise (like my baby playing), then it was as loud as his voice! ... I have now ordered the Panasonic PVDC152 which is supposed to have good sound. We'll see...	0
"Willie Williams and his fraternity brothers from ""the University"" (Stanford thinly disguised) go through the second world war and return to pick up their lives. Their problems are as expected: the cold war, the Vietnam War, their alienated offspring, and -- par for the course for Drury -- latent homosexuality among some of the brothers and marital problems (usually boredom and the greener grass syndrome) among most of the others. Trite as it sounds, the book will entertain you, especially if you formed an attachment to this group whom Drury first introduced in ""Toward What Bright Glory"". Even though it is a distinctly mid brow read, chances are if you start it, you'll hang on until the not so surprising end."	0
"This book is full of tabloid lies and speculation. If you really want to know what happened in 93' the book to read is ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes. Raymond your book is garbage and you know it. You and your entire family are money hungry greedy people going after MJ to destroy his legacy. The facts about the 93' case are out there you just need to seek them. Here is a list of reads and visuals to start with:1. ""Was Michael Jackson Framed?"" 1994 GQ article by Mary Fisher2. ""Redemption"" by Geraldine Hughes about 1993 case3. ""Michael Jackson Conspiracy"" by Aphrodite Jones bout the 2005 trial4. ""The Untold story of Neverland"" DVD by Larry Nimmer5. ""The Visual Documentary"" by Adrian GrantIt is really sad that the media controls people the way they want too. Wake up America the media is keeping the ""TRUTH"" from you by not giving you the whole story."	0

I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money.	0
if you are a construction guy a straight edge is critical, they are sometimes hard to find at a good price/quality. this one fit the bill and fits [tightly] in my stabilla 8' case with a level.	1
Oh dear. If 7 brides for 7 brothers is one of your favorite movies then by all means buy 8 women which is equally silly. Life is Weird and so is this film directed by Francois Ozon who should have been kicked out of the academy for this one. Arnaud De Moleron, the set director, should never be employed again. The set is so ugly is steals attention away from the silly action and songs in film. Fanny Ardant is beginning to look quite piggy in the face although her figure is still fine. If the intention was to make a movie in the vein of 1950s Hollywood drama/musical this film fails on all accounts. Unless you are a die hard fan of someone in the film don't waste your money.	0
I enjoyed the book, it was easy reading, and it helped to clarify why I keep getting the same results in my life.	1
"I have ordered the Squeem on three different occasions, trying a large, medium and small as my size changed after having twins. Unfortunately, I was disapointed every time and I returned it after trying it on. I don't know why I kept trying aside from desperation. It just gave me a very weird shape. Sure, it cinched in my waist at the sides but what I needed was to flatten my muffin top. I basically felt as if it squeezed my waist in and pushed all my ""excess"" down into the lower half of my torso making my muffin top even worse. I'm giving the product the benefit of the doubt with two stars thinking maybe it's just my body type that is the problem. I have a long torso at 5'10 and 140lbs. Great product in concept but didn't work at all for me."	0
As a smallville fan, i find this DVD box set excellent, but i would like in the fuiture to find more episodes commented by the actors or the crew, and what happend with the webisodes that use to have smallville, like the chloe chronicles, or somethings like that.	1
We had guests that used it last weekend. They said it felt like a real bed. I was so suprised on how quickly it inflated and deflated. The cord hides away in a handy compartment. It keeps its air pressure. No need to carry around a separate pump. Our dog wanted to adopt it as her own bed. The dog jumped on it and tested it toughness. It passed with flying colors.	1
I was sent seed packets that where packaged for spring 2010. I doubt those are going to grow but guess I'll see. There werent very many seeds in them either. And good thing I had other planting instructions because the packets didn't desplay deepth to plant the seeds or if the plant liked shade or sun. Some packages only made 2 1/2 six packs once planted. One packet of seeds should make at least 5 or 6 sixpacks.Thought I was getting a deal but got less seeds and old seeds when I could have went to Homedepot and got better stuff for $2 more. Wont be buying seeds from this Generic Company anymore.	0
I was looking for a shower door that could open from either the left or the right and I did not want one to choose for me. This door ticks and fits all the right boxes in that department. I like the crystal glass effect too. It is very clear and allows a lot of light into the shower hub. It is frameless too which is what was asked for by the wife.Its sturdy quarter of an inch thick glass also is a nice feature. But most of all the pivot door is a feature I got on with too.	1
What a good movie. However as good as it is ,it sometimes takes on a child-like sense of humor.... The acting is ok. But i wish they had a stronger story line...The guy who plays satan is great. And Many of the parts are jaw dropping..... I give it 4 out of 5 stars,,,,I do say buy it because when you see it you will want to see it again......	1
The chain is so thin and flimsy, I'm afraid that if I wear it I'll lose it. I think that it might fall off of my neck. Years ago, I had a similar chain that did that, but I only paid about $6.00 or $7.00 for it. It was sterling silver, too. And, the whole necklace is so little and scarce. The way that it was made to look in the adverisement made me feel like I was really getting a good deal. Instead, I feel like I got taken. I thought that the chain would at least be thicker and stronger--I mean, for $30.00. If I could've seen the actual chain before buying it, I wouldn't have paid more than $10.00 for it.	0
Fahrenheit 451 has been on my lengthy 'to read' list for quite a while. My book club selected it this month and I'm glad I finally took the time to dive into the book.What I found most chilling about the book was not the book burning although the idea makes me shudder, but the picture of a society that's lost all respect and sense of reality. Montag's wife with her television 'family' distressed me as the seeds exist in so many ways in our society. Likewise the premise that letting minority voices rule eventually leads to all voices needing to be the same provokes thought.My only complaint would be the suddenness of the book's conclusion. I was following Montag with great excitement, but wanted more answers than I had by the end of the book.I'd also recommend reading the afterward. Great perspective from Bradbury and some ironic moments.	1
I was teased rather mercilessly after I first purchased this domed stand, but it quickly one of our favorite kitchen storage pieces! In addition to its old-fashioned beauty, it is a wonderful storage and serving piece for cakes, pies, and tarts. The dome is very solid to protect desserts but also fits nicely (and heavily) onto the base, keeping things fresh at room temperature. Highly recommended!	1
Jams with 2 pages jams with 10 pages. I basically have to sit here and babysit the scanner the whole time. I could scan my documents faster one page at a time on a regular scanner. Returning it as we speak.	0
While this book does not dive into the details as some other reviewers have pointed out it does provide concise and easy to read chapters. I bought it specifically for the chapters on integrating with Apache and Struts. I found both chapters excellent not to detailed views of how each worked and what I needed to do to use it.This book will not hold your hand but is an excellent guide along the way.	1
This is one of the all-time most boring books. I do not recommend reading it at all. The introduction is incredibly long, and incredibly boring. Also, it doesn't really have the sort of plot that would make it a book you can't put down. I personally fell asleep four different times reading this book. I had much higher expectations for this book. If you are looking for a classic to read, I would recommend The Count Of Monte Cristo, not this book.	0

"This product was suggested to help with low thyroid--and ""cold body syndrome"" which is related to low thyroid.My morning temperature was often 96 degrees or lower. Within one half hour of taking this guggul, my temperature was up to 97 or 98 and stayed there for about 4 hours. Increased metabolism is giving me more energy and I am losing weight.This brand seems to be working better than the other brand I took for a while."	1
We store our diapers in a dry pail in the baby room and some days, it's pretty unbearable in there. As much as I love everything about my baby and don't mind his poo much at all, he will have weeks when he's sick and the smell of his poo tests even a mother's love. That's when you need this.	1
I am a guy who wears formal shirt and tie to my office, so I have lots of shirts and I know a good shirt when I wear it.This was my first purchase of a Bill Blass Dress Shirt, so I did not quite know what to expect.Well I have now worn it a few times and it has been laundered and ironed and is still holding up well.I would recommend this shirt which I bought at an excellent price in a recent Amazon sale.	1
Good story wish it would continue into another story line. Love this book but where is the next one to follow	1
Don't get me wrong, this is a totally enjoyable listen, but is it just me or is every single song on the disc the same. Hell, they're even the same as on Cold & Bouncy, Hawaii and Gideon Gaye. The one thing that makes this album different is John McEntire's wonderful production and the 'Lab girls. If you dont own any High Llamas disc, start here... but if you already do, dont expect anything new.	0
"Wow, I know that I can be a fool, but I was definately robbed of $16.00, even after reading the front and back of this very deceiving book! I mean, I know that I need help with anger, but this book just seemed to make me ANGRIER! I spent $16.00 on a wanna-be Bible (Something I could have gotten for free at my FORMER Church) and the contents only seemed to anger me more! Not only did half of their text not make sense, their descriptions of anger and recognizing anger only seemed to categorize the entirety of this country! The verbage used and perspective in which this ~story~ is told borderlines an autobiography of a man named ""Tom"". If you like a good bedtime story, like to waste time and money, and do not need real anger management help, then by all means buy this ""novel"". My opinion~ Dont waste your time or money, you already wasted enough reading my review! Kyle...."	0
This movie is not only funny but leaves you with a need to see it again and again. Drew Barrymore and Adam Sandler are the perfect match for the perfect romantic comedy. The twist on this romance (and the fact that it was filmed in Hawaii) gives the film a magical quality that warms the heart.	1
Fantastic Kindle version of this book! The autobiography is an excellent insight into this man who had so much influence in the founding of the United States.	1
"Futuro makes another version that is like a compression sleeve that extends above and below the elbow and has two forearm pressure points. I find it to be much easier to use. This one goes on fine, then slides down frequently. If I try pulling my sleeve up and adjusting it, it slides down again when I try to get the sleeve back down over it. If you might be using this while wearing long sleeves, or you don't want to have to make adjustments throughout the day, I recommend checking out the other version that just says ""Elbow"" and not this sport version."	0
I bought these hoping I could make my Bluetooth headset fit better but these things made it impossible to wear. The design might be ergonomic in theory but I could not stand having these in my ear. They seem to be made of a very thick silicone that has a slightly slippery feel to them. I was really disappointed with these. Stay away if you have small ear canals.	0
Haing missed this book in school, somehow, I've always meant to read it since I keep hearing great things about it. I don't know if my expectations were too high or I'm just missing something that everyone else sees, but I didn't like it.The idea that political correctness grows into something so ridiculous that not only are books burned, but the houses that they occupy are burned also was just impossible for me to swallow. Add to that only a single character that was likeable at all (and she was killed off pretty early), then a pretty boring story to go along with it, and the only reason I was able to finish it was because it was so short.I don't see any reason why anyone would want to read this book, but I'm clearly in the minority on this one, so maybe you'll like it better than I did.	0
It might not be the strongest but so far it has done it's job very well. It looks very nice and I am pleased. Just make sure that you dont leave it loose or it will fall on your head. Overall a nice product for the price.	1
I wanted something a little more specific to the African American child in terms of race and self esteem considering the prejudice that my child will have to come to terms with.This book only offered one chapter on that and not a very insightful one.	0
Based on her theosophic and new thought principles, these poems had tremendous influence on helping people to come into a sense of personal power and independence. Truly a most inspirational woman!	1
"It is too bad that this is practically the only one of the kind. The aim is great, the contents are great, but the author does not know how to write a technical book. The author refers to concepts and terms that are yet to be defined or never defined at all. For example, at the very beginning, the author talks about ""violet"" and ""purple"". Am I the only one who did not know ""violet"" means a color of a single frequency, whereas ""purple"" is a color of combined frequencies? This is a No-No for mathematicians and scientists. For those of who are already familiar with Color Theory, the book must be a great assurance, articulation or enhancement of their existing knowledge, but for those who are new and try to learn as an artist, this is a nightmare. I am the latter kind. The only reason I could finish it was because I am familiar with fundamental physics and optics already."	0
Let me start with my internet connection was great. I checked my connection and my settings 7 times. And I had rented another movie from Amazon and it played flawlessly. And just to be absolutely sure I rented yet another movie(all 48 HR paid movies) and that one worked perfect. At least 10 times I for a error message saying you are having trouble playing this title please try again or choose another movie. Or you are unable to view this movie etc... When it did play it was terrible quality. Or a scene would freeze up but the audio still continued. Very dissapointed.	0
"I did not like this book at all - the author promises to tell all the secret truth about Caruso (the stuff that has never been told before, you know...) - in the end he just tells what everybody already knew, only that he criticizes as much as he can - without any foundation just to reveal the promissed secret. If you're looking for a good book about Caruso take ""My father and my family"" in the unabridged version by Caruso jr. (the best ever written about Caruso) or the book by Michael Scott."	0
This is the worst cd i have ever heard. If you like no hooks and, emotionless dribble then this is the record for you. was this recorded through an A.M. radio? I wouldn't give this cd to my worst enemy.THIS SUCKS!!! I want my money back!!!	0
"Certainly on my ten-best list, ROSEMARY'S BABY is one of the most frightening films ever made. The genius of the film is that it juxtaposes the mundane with the most beastly and achieves it with little graphic violence. The carnage occurs mostly off-screen and we see the crowd in the street or hear the terrible news over the phone just as we would in real-life.Polanski plays (or preys) masterfully on natural human paranoia and allows the viewer's imagination to construct the most heinous outcome. Mia Farrow is the innocent who is led by her ""loving"" husband, respected doctor and eccentric neighbors into a woman's worst nightmare."	1
Awesome special effects, great set, and a group talented actors,but the film didn't reach expectations. The script and story was so bad that not even Entrapment's Catherine Zeta Jones, and Episode I Liam Neeson couldn't save the movie. Sometimes the movie gets interesting vand you get into it, but that's just a start, the ending messes up the movie.	0
1. Yes--> I am a Larry Carlton fan--> I've seen him numerous times over the years. As a baseline, my favorite albums are his earlier efforts etc... My favorite song (s) are strikes twice and mulberry street.2. Which makes this all the more frustrating--> how can such a great musician turn out such... completely boring music? I don't understand it and I guess I never will. The bottomline is--> if you tend to like neutral, tepid music (ie background music)--> this will be fine. Otherwise, skip this effort via Larry and pray that he comes back to life and puts out a good album.	0
This exercise video is not fun--none of us like it. The moves are not hip or fun, and they become monotonous and boring, like you're waiting for it to end. It seems really old or outdated. The instructor is friendly and happy, but her face is really sweaty during the video. The sound quality is not the best. There must be a better kids' exercise video out there--we need some fun, hip, new moves with a great beat and really good music and alot more energy! This dvd is not worth it-invest in something else, like a huge exercise ball--we all love that!	0
This is a great pitcher. Steaming milk in this pitcher is quick and easy. The bottom of the pitcher and the sides get hot when the milk is steamed, which is very helpful in determining when to turn off the steaming wand. It is well built, easy to clean, and dish washer safe. Would definitely recommend.	1
i expected this movie to be terrible, but might as well see it. I was proved wrong. My favorite part has to be the scene at goofy goober's.FINAL THOUGHT - buy, see, rent, steal,or borrow this movie	1
This sounds like karaoke. I wish it didn't - but it does. I'm a white man married to an Indian girl - I love Indian music, Chutney is cool, reggae, etc. - and the lead singer is attractive - but it really, really sounds like karaoke....I can't escape that fact. And...yes....it is very repetitive, mundane, same sounding music throughout the whole CD. But, it doesn't matter because todays ear for music is pretty much on the deaf side. Simple and repetitive is the cornerstone of todays musical taste. Oh well - I'll watch the video though - she's cute. But, it is still a talentless serving up of supposed 'world music'. What a bunch of crap that is! Listen to 'The Mysterious Voices of Bulgaria' or 'Kuch Kuch Hota Hai' if you want REAL world music. What? It's boring? Then you don't really like 'World Music' - lol.	0
"I really hoped this would be fabulous, but it just isn't. All the songs sound the same. Same tempo, same back ground and back-up. RCA or whoever told Clay to sing all the same type of songs was way off base. When done live, one song only, then Clay does come through as we know him. Where is ""Unchained Melody""? One of the songs that got him to the top two on Idol should have been included."	0
I give the 4 stars because of the vast quantity of material used in this documentary, photos, interviews, as well as testimonies make this documentary a good option for those who want to learn about the Jonestown massacre. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because this DVD doesn't have subtitles and basically doesn't show to much about the aftermath of the event's.	1
For anybody who loves Michael Wadleigh's Woodstock boxset and wants even more film document of this mecca, then this is it. D.A.Pennebaker (Monterey Pop Festival) and Chris Hegedus to a great job directing this documentary of three days of peace and music and presenting the music in order as it happened. There are a few quick shots and longer cuts of festival goers that were in the Wadleigh film but it blends in well to this 3 hour film. I highly recommend this documentary from this historical landmark event of 1969.	1
"This is a great book with a whole new way of approaching running. Some of it I intuitively have known and practiced. A lot of it is a completely different way of ""practicing"" running."	1
Shirley Jackson's novel The Haunting of Hill House is the greatest haunted house story ever written, and the 1963 film version is one of the finer examples of the horror genre ever committed to film, but this illegitimate 1999 re-make is a disgrace to the memory of the author, an inferior descendant of the original movie, and an all-around bad (bad bad bad!) motion picture. Alternating between groaningly, achingly terrible and downright silly, 1999's The Haunting loses its threadbare plot in a special effects quagmire, obliterates any of the greatness it could easily have inherited from this predecessors, fails to make use of the magnificent understated creepiness of the novel, and squanders a talented cast. Not only is it offensive to witness what was done with Shirley Jackson's work, this is just a rotten waste of time to see.	0
This boot fits to size and is comfortable. I would purchase again. I use to purchase boots from LL Bean.	1
First of all, the wire came out as i was untangling the cord, so it is very fragile. It is too tall. It's ears are too high above my girl's clit for her too feel anything. It's not the greatest thing in the world, and i do not recommend that you buy it. huge disappointment.	0
I am on my third cord, after returning it twice (within one year!). This cord doesn't charge consistently, and so it makes your screen flicker, and music and videos skip. You have to fiddle with the cord for 10 minutes to even get it to charge at all sometimes. Believe me, it's not worth the lower cost for this - just get a more expensive one that actually works.	0
"I am an avid reader, specially of books in the English language. The movie ""The Scarlet Letter"" has been a favorite of mine, but reading other reviews of the novel (other editions) here in Amazon, prompted me to read it. People kept saying they were dissapointed with the movie and vice versa; people kept saying they could not deal with Hawthorne's 19th century language. But I could deal perfectly with the idiom, even though it's not my first language. Both the movie and the novel are excellent, although different."	1
I used this camera for a year untill during a period of a couple weeks of not being turned on, something to do with the light sensor malfunctioned. I think all Canon ZR series cameras are inclined to having buggy hardware and I dont remcomend buying one.	0
Perfect for the hot dog bar at my son's Mickey Mouse Carnival themed birthday party. The dogs were thoroughly cooked, and the machine itself was precious. Break down of the item allowed for easy cleaning and storing after the event. The machine is covered by a thin plastic (not fantastic quality), but it was sturdy enough to get the job done and to be expected for the price.	1
I am using this card on my new PC that I just built. I bought this as a cheap alternative to a USB type card. I must say, I will never do USB again. Strong signal and NO dropouts.

This the the absolute worst war movie ever made. It is full of HORRIBLE acting (Sean Penn is no Tom Berringer in Platoon!). The film is full of geographical inaccuracies (a train on the side of a mountain in Vietnam???). Trust me, save your money. This is blatantly an anti-war movie and has no purpose other than for some hollywood celebrity pundits trying to make soldiers look like criminals.	0
Ok.....I threw away the one I was using in my office before this because it was no longer getting my cups of coffee hot...only tepid and therefore wasting energy. Silly me. I was SURE ( since I read all reviews) that this mug warmer by Mr. Coffee would be so great that I just tossed my old one before receiving this. HUGE mistake! This has got to be the worst product I have ever purchased from Amazon! I tried for days with several different shaped mugs of tea or coffee ...nothing..none of them got more than BARELY tepid! It is very hot to the touch.....but for some ridiculous reason it WILL NOT HEAT YOUR CUP OF LIQUID....and I'm speaking of a hot cup of coffee to start with! I was so surprised that I kept trying different mugs...thinking maybe it's the shape or...??? Nothing worked. Nothing.Please do not waste your time. Do not purchase this product!!	0
After 4.5 months, the adapter died. I contacted Macally about the one year warranty and learned :1. the only way they will issue a refund is if the adapter causes a fire!2. I needed to send the adapter to the manufacturer in California for them to evaluate--I would be without a power cord for a week. They said the replacement adapter might be refurbished.Ultimately, I went to the Apple store and purchased a Mac power cord.	0
My daughter has been using Pampers diapers since she was born. We tried Huggies size 4, but they felt cheap and thin. Oh and it leaked everytime. So we went back to Pampers Cruisers. She is at size 5 now and I was wondering why Baby Dry was cheaper, so I decided to try a box. Baby Dry didn't do it's diaper job. She has wet her car seat, chair so many times already having baby dry diapers on. We decided to go back to Cruisers. They were the best for my daughter. Pampers overnight for night time use were the best for her as well. Ofcourse there were occasional leaks, but it is minimum. Sometimes leaks happen, but at the minimum is okay.	0
It's intelligent, insightful, and very funny. Brilliant performances by Julie Walters and Michael Caine in a story that you wish was true. I see very little that can be improved here, and it's one of those very rare films that I'll put back on my little shelf to watch again later.	1
I have not received it yet am very disappointed as I was told I would get it by the official release date am still waiting	0
really great movie packed with a lot of action keeps you off on the edge you don't get bored or tired of watch it always something happening	1
My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!	1
I've know Johnny France since he was a young man. Without his dogged determination, these two killers might not have ever been captured. Don Nichols is still in prison and most likely will never get paroled. This book tells fascinating tale almost too strange to believe in these modern times. Great reading!!	1
It is 1888 and vampires are everywhere! From holding elite positions in the government to overwhelming the slums of Whitechapel, vampires have integrated into society. How would the presence of vampires change Victorian, England? This is exactly what Mr. Kim Newman tackles in his thriller novel 'Anno Dracula'. Not only is Newman spot on in his depiction of London in 1888, but he also brings in a wide range of fictional characters from Victorian novels including their authors!Characters Charles Beauregard and Genevieve Dieudonne team up to be an unstoppable duo in search of Jack the Ripper. It is hard to put the book down once you've started reading. So glad Titan Books reprinted this! I hope they continue with the sequel Anno Dracula: The Bloody Red Baron, which takes place in 1918, or I will have to get crafty and find an old copy myself!	1
Very clearly written with a minimum of jargon. Basic principles easy to understand even for the non-economist, but topics were not oversimplified. Essential reading for anyone who wants to make informed decisions in these troubled economic times.	1
This story is a great one involving magic, different worlds, knights and all the things that make fairy tales great. Any child who likes to read and has an active imagination will like this story. Geared a little more for boys, but I think most girls would appreciate it just as much. This was a favorite at our house growing up and is already on my son's bookshelf, though he is a little too young for it just yet.	1
"Will (Bonnie ""Prince"" Billy) Oldham is amazing! Don't be swayed by the close minded folks who have reviewed some of his other albums, ""Eww, he has a beard and he's balding! Oh no, this is weird!"" Those are the same folks who rag on Tom Waits, ""I just can't get past his voice! It's too gravelly! That's not singing!"". Will Oldham is great. Buy this album and really listen to it, you won't be disappointed"	1
The price was Great butThis was completely different from what I'm used to. The diapers look different. And ever since I used one.. My baby suffers deA horrible rash. His skin peals off and it has gotten worst over time.	0
This book was 9th grade honors English required reading...our teachers beat it to death, and it was really awful anyway. The book was boring, pointless, and plotless, until towards the end. I would not reccommed it.	0
I bought this toy for my 4 year old for Christmas and all you have to do is touch it and the pieces fall off. Durability is not even a consideration for this toy. I have never wasted my money on a worse toy than this. I really wanted the other bat cave listed but it is out of production...scary thing is that this is what they replaced it with. Do yourself a favor, don't waste the money I did!!!!	0
This book has flowery language and the story line seems to have potential but the book never goes any where. I skimmed much of it, hoping it would develop plot and character, but it really never did. The plot and language were repetitive and didn't hold my attention. It seemed as though the author had a point she was trying hard to get to but it just never happened.	0
The fasteners on this thing are awful. I was driving down the highway and after going over a bridge the bike flew off my car because the fasteners stripped and came undone.Spend more money on a nicer bike rack. Now I have to get a new bike and rack instead of paying maybe 50 bucks more and still having a bike.	0
"The music on this album could be incredible.However, there is low-level line noise on every track, the audible range of the tracks seems like it's been ""chopped"", making all the tracks sound ""muddled."" One track should flow seamlessly to the next, but the mastering between tracks results in extreme volume level changes.I am by no means an audiophile, but the MP3 quality for this album is just terrible. (I don't know if the same mastering issues exist for the cd version of this album)."	0

The movie is amazing and worth the price. This is one of the best movies of 2005. Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer. Disc 2 is the Worst DVD I have ever seen in my life. The menu system is a series of comic panels that has only one feature per screen and you can't tell what you are looking at with out actually starting the feature, most of the time anyway. I can't watch the Disc, its garbage and torture trying to deal with. Don't (DO NOT) even think about getting this version. I am going to return my copy to get the Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition). I never get the one disc version but I will have that one now. Save your money (even if it's only $5 [if it was a fifty cents I would still tell you to say your money] it's not worth it.	0
The special effects are the only thing that saved this movie. The characters are shallow, the plot is either non-existant or predictable, and the ending is unbelievable. If you're interested in this movie, I would recommend the 1963 version instead. It doesn't rely so heavily on special effects and in turn has great characterization and plot (not to mention a more believable setting). The DVD takes longer than usual to cue up or didn't work at all in both my players. (I tried two different discs, same problem.)	0
I just got the DT box to replace 2 tivo series boxes. Basically you get the same box with the excepttion of recording 2 shows. For me was better because now I pay only 1 bill insead for 2 boxes.But tivo has been very slow to release better boxes. If my cable company would have a better box that doesn't crash I'd be using it. Thee box has 2 tuners, HD, more space and etc...Tivo 2 dt is not worth it for new subscribers. But for returning tivo users then yes.	1
"well, they promised me ""NEW"" but this book is far from being new. Marking all over the book means it's not new, the cover torn at some parts means that this isn't new!!"	0
This movie makes a person consider the subject of Alien contact. I thought some of the alien depictions needed to be more realistic, but it showed real human emotion in the various situations that were presented in the story and the actors did preform their parts well.	1
This movie has a lot of action, and my husband loved it. I do, however, warn you about the language. I wouldn't have any underage viewers present if you watch, and the language even made me want to leave the room, but if your okay with that, the movie is very action-packed.	1
This is wonderful. I wish these folks were around, young, andon the Radio and Screen today. Put this on DVD PLEASE, my VHS tape will wear out fromintroducing todays kids to these folks.	1
Needs to be pumped up at least twice in the night. High rise makes it easy for older people to use.UPDATE:Amazon was outstanding. I wrote saying that the bed was leaking too much to be comfortable.. an immediate replacemnt was sent and i printed out a free shipping label online.The new bed is perfect.. three kids slept on it together and they were fast asleep when i checked later.I left the airbed out next two days and no air had leaked yet.I was lucky I think to have got a good piece.Thank you Amazon.	1
"This is a fantastic resource. I have just received my copy and already I am in love with it. It is very well-written, and strikes a nice balance between the structure of the langauge and usability. I especially like that the author is no fan of prescriptivists, and so presents ""Hindi as she is spoke"". I would not say that it is ""better"" than Snell's TYH, but it takes a slightly different approach, and is, in my opinion a great complement to the other work.My only gripes are the way that all the devanagari is stuck at the back (grr!) and that I had to buy the book and CD separately. Even with those minuses, it is absolutely worth it, and I would rate it a must have."	1
The singers are very good, both of them has a very nice voice and they are talented singer. I enjoy listening this music very much	1
All I can really say is I didn't even finish the book. I love romances but this one wasn't for me. I found it too much to read about sexual desire and how the body responds to it, that was too much for me. I would say this book should say blush or some kind of note to let people know its not clean romance.	0
Install is simple recetion is good and removes the need for phone line. We have multiple tivos but cannot transfer between devices because we aquired units from other people and tivo will not give us permission to tranfer unless you own device. All in all good product/price.	1
I love Pampers, they definitely do not last the 12 hours they say they will. I have to change my kids in the middle of the night sometimes because they wake up soaked. My one child just turned 1..and the other just turned 2. The diapers work A LOT better than other brands I have tried. I was a Luvs fan until they changed and they just weren't as good anymore :( so back to Pampers I went.	1
"I have owned this printer 6 months. I purchased it based on price, relatively compact size and all in one capability. I have had minor problems with paper jams. The print quality in the first 5 months was good for documents, good for photos. Copy quality was good. After 6 months, I was unable to print black text. I contacted technical support. They were not knowledgeable and I spent 2 hours online removing printer cartridges, cleaning printer cartridges, aligning printer cartridges (the extent of the ""support""). I was told that the printer would be replaced with a refurbished unit and I would need to provide a credit card number to guarantee the exchange. My confidence in the ""refurbished"" unit is not very high. Luckily I have a replacement policy with CompUSA. Overall, not a reliable unit."	0
I am in 9th grade and I am 15 years old, but there is something you do not know about me. I was recently touched by means of words in merely a book. No more than three weeks ago I finished this book, and I must admit that while reading the book, it did not grasp me. Yes, it was able to keep me engaged in the novel and continue reading, but it was not my favorite. That is just the begining. The last chapter touched me in a way I could never imagine possible. Even though I did not rate this five stars, I am sure many of you would. I am sure many of you would rate this ten stars if given a chance. There is so much for one to explore and ponder within this novel, it is fraught with questions. I believe this book can not be missed and I do not usually say this, because I am one to believe that not all people have the same taste for books, as all people do not have the same taste for chocolate, and I recomend this to everyone. The themes are as thick as crunchy peanutbutter.	1
I really want to like it. It is certainly better than the Huggies I bought before but the quality is no where close to the pamper's cruiser we have been using. It is good if you knew you will change diaper frequently as it will hold just one pee then start to sag. I haven't run into any leaking issue yet as I now use it only when I knew my baby will not stay with it for long. We use it as temporary diaper that is why I still give it a two star rating. It is cheaper for more diapers, you get what you paid for.	0
A very sad story of 2 lives lost,but they are remembered by there family. VERY true but sad story. RIP Julie and Robin Kerry.	1
"Constantine is based on the D.C. comics characters ""Hellblazer"",i also dont know too much about the comics, so was gradingjust as a film and have to admit it rocked the house!!!Way to go Keanu, the cast and director. Constantine has somegreat special effects, the acting is particulary good fromeveryone from Reeves to Rachel Weisz.He plays a sort of witchcraft doctor who performs exorcismsand gets rid of demons. Suddenly, well I dont want to revealtoo much, but lets just say that this movie is worth the moneyto see it in the theater. So see ""Constantine""!!!"	1
I am currently DEPed into the US Navy.Before taking the ASVAB, I took several online practice exams, as well as the first practice exam inside this book. I didn't do too well on certain portions of the exam.Focusing on the things I had trouble on, and brushing up on the rest of the stuff, I studied for about a month.When I went to take my ASVAB for the first time, I did well on every exam, making a 94 AFQT (scored higher than 94% of applicants).I absolutely recommend this book. It provides more knowledge than is needed to pass the test, and keeps things interesting with side-notes, trivia, and funny comments.	1
This classic is full of inspiration. It should be a must read for ever high schooler in America. It is one of the essential readings for understanding the heart of the total American experience.	1
It is not worth buying ! If this a must read for you go to our public library. You just might thank me!	0
This is a must read for every Man. It is spiritually up lifting and you don't have to be a preacher to get it. I could not put it down once I started. This is going in my Library and I will revisit it often.	1
Bought this product after hooking it up I found out you need a telephone jack behind your tv to plug in a phone connection which would tie up my phone line while the TiVo calls to get the tv programing schedule in your area. I sent it back. If the specs would have informed me ahead of time I would not have purchased this product.What a hassle. Shipped it back.	0
I have had these for a little over a year now. The edges are starting to chip off, and they have been stained a little. They are ok, but not wonderful. I feel like for a Kitchen Aid product, they should be much better.	0
Among other weaknesses, it was clear that the author didn't know San Francisco very well. That should have been a warning! Too many cliches, not enough depth at all- this could have been a rich disturbing story, instead it was one dimensional and rather juvenile. Dissapointing	0
Being fair skinned, this is the perfect product to give my skin a little color without the damaging UV rays! Love it!!	1
"Australian Paul Kelly and his Messengers released ""Under The Sun"" in 1988. I loved Paul's first 3 CD's he released here in America. Kind of a rock-country sound on most of discs. Peter Bull's keyboards are the main attraction on this set I think. Steve Connolly adds some fine guitar licks here also. Great songs include, ""Dumb Things"" his 2nd hit in America #16 mainstream rock. ""Same Old Walk"", ""Big Heart"", ""Forty Miles To Saturday Night"", ""Untouchable"", ""To Her Door"" (A favorite), ""Under The Sun"", ""Desdemona"", the banjo rave-up ""Happy Slave"",""Crosstown"", the churchy ""Little Decisions"" and the mournful ""Bicentennial"". Paul's still kicking and releasing albums."	1
"This text book is absolutely horrible. I'm a third-year Mech Eng student. I've taken plenty of classes on hard subjects, so I know when a text book just plain sucks. This book does a pathetic job of explaining examples and basic concepts. I've spent hours trying to figure out assumptions that they should have just mentioned in the first place. And the poorly explained examples don't prepare you for the actual chapter problems. Because of the ""wordy"" writing style of the authors, basic concepts sound more complicated than they actually are; getting through the reading is a slow and tedious process.The book is utterly sterile. The only colors you'll see inside it are black and a little blue; there isn't even a picture of an actual circuit in this book. It's like it's writen for a machine."	0
One serving set. Ive been ordering this stuff for years to build a set for my wife. Very nice china washes well looks good in the china cabinet.	1
"To those seeking an outline of what education needs to practice so ""no child is left behind"" this book is a starting point about how people learn. The flow of the book is easy to follow and considers the research findings of how the brain learns in stages of life. Unlike those who consider brain research a ""fad"", I know from application of the knowledge in this book, the influential changes do produce positive results for students. In the world of ""accountability"" the tools of Brain Based teaching will allow students and teachers a solution in ""leveling the field"" for the students from less fortunate environments, which politicians are clueless about in regards the obstacles of ""survivalists of poverty"". I highly reccommend this book to those wishing to ""get off the dead horse"" and provide a productive environment for education in the 21st century."	1
The Pyramid Bottom Bracket bike stand is a great option to take along on those overnight rides. For example, when I do the DALMAC ride it allows me to stand my bike up during the overnight stays instead of laying it down on the ground or trying to find a (scarce) tree at the campground. With my bike standing I can then hang my riding clothes on it to dry in the sun. For these reasons I highly recommend this portable bike stand.	1
The info on this audio book, Death du Jour (received from bordeebook), didn't indicate that it is abridged. I didn't like it much, partly due to her poor use of similes, partly because I got tired of the plot development. I didn't listen to the last 45 minutes.	0
"I am writing this review because I don't want another person to read the editor's reviews and believe that this CD is anything but garbage. I am a huge fan of Dirty Vegas, but by far, this is not their best effort. In fact, it took no effort on their part at all. They put a couple of songs from the 80's and 90's and compiled them on one CD. There wasn't any great beats, vocal overlays, or anything to speak of that would have made this CD unique. I could have made this CD at home on my computer and ""mixed"" it better than this. Please, if you value your money spend it on something else. Let this CD go to the wayside. You will be better for it. I ended up giving my copy away!"	0
Wonderful movie!! Beat Takeshi is a great director and has fantastic presence in any movie he stars! Fans of Pulp Fiction or True Romance should enjoy this movie. I won't go into the storyline, you can read that on the preview, but you won't be disappointed if you like action movies. This is one of the better ones!	1
If you are a fan of public television, you are going to love this combo! Every title was entertaining, without all the rude sex and violence found in so many of today's box office blockbusters. Delightful and humorous features for only pennies, in your own living room.	1
This charger is much sturdier than the mac version (which my cat chewed through in a matter of days). I'd read another review that said this adapter didn't work on the aluminum PowerBooks, but it works great for mine. In addition, the product arrived in about one day. I ordered it on a Friday morning and received it on Saturday before noon. I would highly reccomend this product.	1
I've had this card installed since Nov. 2006 and just now found out that the 2 Firewire ports only work intermittently. I thought my new camcorder was messed up when I tried to use the Firewire port on the Iogear card. But when I plugged into another non-Iogear available Firewire slot, the camcorder worked. Now I have to go through the hassle of trying to get warranty work for the Iogear card. The USB ports on the card have worked okay.Update: Over 3 weeks and I'm still awaiting my warranty work repair/replacement from Iogear.3-23-07 Update: Finally got the warranty replacement. Everything seems to be working now. I would now rate this about 3 stars.	0
"Buy ""The Synonym Finder"" if you want a REALLY good thesaurus. I am only familiar with the first edition of ""Roget's II,"" but I consider that edition to be among the worst volumes in print."	0
"I have only read the first 44 pages of this book, so I'd need to read the rest. So far, though, it is interesting but seems fuzzy. The writer makes a lot of claims but I was rarely sure if they were proven or just speculation. This is the kind of sentence that makes me queasy:""Given all the activations happening at once [in the brain], physical performance probably uses 100 precent of the brain"" (p. 39).Probably? Why? Does any one activity use 100 percent of the brain? And if physical performance does, why is that important?"	0
If you have large/thick wrists do not purchase this product. Each weight is a pound of tiny beads inside an oddly shaped design. Think of an oval that is thick on only two opposite facing curves. The given picture shows the thick sides but the surrounding edges are very thin.Cutting to the chase there is a high probability that the cloth will be cut or worn out very fast and you will have tiny beads leaking and spilling everywhere.Look elsewhere for wrist weights.	0
"This is long overdue. Most people get only so far along in the Modern Primitive scene without ""going native"". Here is a book that gives excellent and easily followed guidelines for anyone who wants more from their experiences as a Modern Primitve. Combining Piercings, Humor and Good Spirituality, this is a great buy."	1
This DVD is in my library of Great films because it was entertaining but at the same time had a moral I'd like my son to understand.It was comedic in its dealing with the theme of the decades of the 60's and the 70's ( and even today) yet at the same time dealt seriously and respectfully with the topic.There was one theme, of a group's search for recognition of humanity and inalienable rights in the story of a young woman who kills her husband for her freedom and a younger Black man who gives his life in a similar cause. The two ongoing stories were handled in a unique and entertaining manner.I will watch this DVD over again and enjoy it many times in the future. I will watch for other films directed by Antonio Banderas.	1
I bought this for my oldest son because he is interested in learning addition and subtraction. He has only used it four or five times. He gets frustrated that his finger covers the answer and the plastic is so thick it is hard to read anyway. I remember using this toy when I was young and I thought the manufacturers would have developed a better product since materials have changed so much in the past twenty years.	0
I like the movie... Spongebob is charlie brown's counterpart who just happens to live in a pineapple under the sea....	1
I ordered a Canon camera battery. NB-5L.Some company (not Amazon) sent the wrong battery.I tired to send it back. Too complicated. (Many emails, lots of forms.) I found someone who needed the incorrect battery (NB-4L) and gave it to them.Then I went to a real store and bought the correct battery.Bad taste in my mouth remains.	0
"I'm an aviation buff and I'll accept a mediocre screenplay and poor character development if the flying is worthwhile. Sorry to say that this film falls short on all fronts (pun intended). The CGI flying scenes are very contrived, and are sadly inaccurate. The Fokker triplane was not introduced until 1917-not '16 as the plot suggests; the Nieuport 17 had a Gnome rotary engine which revolved around it's own crankshaft, but in closeups, the cylinders are stationary.Now the plot--can there be any more cliches in one movie? I can appreciate campy lines such as ""We can't send those green kids up in those flimsy crates"" when they're delivered by Errol Flynn or Basil Rathbone (The Dawn Patrol) but here the dialogue is flat and the acting is only passable at best.I was hoping that this film would be better than the reviews suggested, but it wasn't. Don't waste your time with this one."	0
I absolutely HATED this movie. It was SUCH a waste of my time. The first ten minutes made the movie seem worth watching, but then the storyline, along with my desire to watch it, fell dramatically after that. It was not worth my time! I couldn't wait for the credits to come. I found myself fast forwarding through parts, just to get through it quicker. The main character, Diane Lane, annoyed me. Plus, the storyline was depressing. Nothing ever went right in her life. I don't see what other people see in it. I would not recommend watching this movie, unless you actually like being bored senseless.	0
"I love this game! I bought one 15 or so years ago when my son was young, good first game as it helps teach turn taking. Little kids love it when the crocodile ""bites"" you! Even timid kids get into the game after an adult gets bitten a few times. Bonus that it's portable, no loose pieces, I purchased this one for my niece's three sons (under the age of 5) and have given it as a gift over and over, really fun game."	1

This is a great product for a caregiver, as I am. The product gets rid of urine ordors in laundry basket and in air. I just love it.	1
A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book.	0
"SPINOUT is another hard movie to sit through, thanks to the weak dialogue and even weaker storyline.Elvis plays a singing race car driver (for the second time), who is being chased by three women. These include a spoiled brat (Shelley Fabares), an erotic author (Diane McBain), and his own drummer (Deborah Walley).The music is actually listenable in this picture. Highlights include ""Stop, Look, and Listen"" and ""I'll Be Back"".Elvis appears to be sleepwalking through this one. His appearance is also disturbing: slightly overweight and his hair looks like a big black ball on his head.Again, not QUITE the worst, but far from the best. Buy something more worthwhile first."	0
this is not nearly as good as The Fringe, etc., but it is very interesting and keeps one on the edge of the seat --- I was surprised when I bought it and am looking forward to seeing the next season that should be released soon.	1
I have liked this movie ever since I first saw it. Since then I have watched it many many times. It's one of those movies that you just can't get sick of. The romantic escapades between Rick and Cheryl are wonderfully depicted through the eyes of a teenager. It's a funny, sad, and romantic movie that I recommend to anyone.	1
I can't understand how anyone could get behind such a bad script. Everything is bloated, the original story by Shirley Jackson is unrecognizable, save for the names of the characters and the house. But the one thing that I did learn from this film is that Lili Taylor could play Mary Poppins -- her take on Eleanor is pure saccharine. I gave the film one star, and that was for the set of the house.	0
"I played the game through all levels of the tutorials and advanced to 'one-on-one' with D. Trump... I did okay. Then I didn't play the game for while and when I went to play it again and get a refresher from the tutorials they were ""GONE""! Now the game will not play at all...... No help from the 'Website' either.. That is just an order site only. So I would not buy this again."	0
"When I purchased this book, I did not read the fine print. There is no labeling whatsoever that this book is fundamentally Christian based. The only indicator is the very fine print on the back cover, which most people would probably not see when purchasing this book. The reasons for anger are in-depth and can easily relate to anyone's life, however, the solutions are not for everyone. If you are not a fundamental Christian, the book can be interpreted as insulting, as not everyone lives their life thinking that everything they do/think/feel/say is based in what the authors may call ""sin."" I wish I would have read reviews myself prior to purchasing this book."	0
If you don't believe in her politics, listen to the music - we can't all be John Lennon. But we could aspire to be Public Enemy - different genre, same ethos. With her minimalist approach, she jettisons a rapid-fire selection of rage, humour, politics [sometimes muddled and confusing], sex...but always arresting and thought provoking. Online pugilists argue the terrorist/Tamil revolutionary ties via her father, and while it's an important salient subject to spelunk, weaving the politico with the dance floor is an exhilarating art I can't overlook based on that writ - Madonna could learn a thing or two about juxtaposing them creatively [see American Life]. My grade: A	1
I honestly think this album shouldnt even be on sale cause it's just that bad! X[	0
"""ChiRunning"" is not a new idea. This running method has beendescribed and advocated by Dr.Nicholas Romanov since 1977 as a pose method of running. Visit his website; [...]. It is very annoying to see the description of ""ChiRunning"" a revolutionary idea by simply attaching ""Chi"" to the pose method [...]. ""Chi"" part of this book is very superficial."	0
I'm very pleased with this product because it has a natural feeling head and makes climaxing easyand can be used in the bathtub,shower or where ever.	1
Great book for people that need to write email. It would be nice to review the grammar rule's from time to time.	1
Baby dry diapers are not quite as soft as the swaddlers, but they haven't leaked at all and I definitely like them better than any Huggies diaper.	1
I am so sorry that I didn't buy this album a long time agao. This album is WONDERFUL! Every single track on this CD is top-quality--absolutely no throw-away songs. They all flow together, one to the next. I cannot begin to describe this album so you're just going to have to get it yourself and see! it's soooooooo worth it.	1
I am a dermatology practitioner and my own kids have sensitive or eczema prone skin- usually use sensitive pampers but out of stock-this diaper made my 12 month old break out within a day of using.	0
Troma should feel ashamed by the horrible quality of this DVD. Argento's films are usually released on Anchor Bay, who does a stellar job with the transfers. This DVD, though, is so full of artifacts in dark scenes that it felt like I was watching a 5 year old video from a rental store. It also didn't feel like it was a FULL letterbox version as parts of the opening credits were cut off on the left and right edges.One of the interviews was OK, but it was really an interview all about Argento's 'Phantom of the Opera'. The other interviews were extremely cheesy as they weren't even done in person -- it was just Dario holding a microphone answering questions that were coming to him over the phone.The movie is quite interesting and better than I expected. It deserves a much better DVD than this extremely cheesy production from Troma, though. Movie gets a 4/5, DVD gets a 1/5.	0
Kari's choreography is always fresh and her cuing superb so even for of us who aren't dancers, we can still move along and get a good workout. Like Kari's other videos, Push is designed to be challenging but doable, and I find that each time I do it, I catch one more thing, making the workout that much more fun. Also, with many videos, after doing them repeatedly, you find that the results aren't as good (i.e. your body has gotten used to the type of movement). With this workout, however, it just keeps getting better and better. Don't be discouraged by the pace of the workouts; just keep moving and have a good time. The steps will come with practice. In the meantime, enjoy yourself and have a great sweat.	1
I liked the service and it got here very quickly, but the book itself really needs to be laminated almost if you actually want to use it, otherwise it looks very used, very soon.	1
I love this novel and ordered it for my mom. The price was high enough [exorbitant] for a paperbound book that I thought that the novel would be complete. The product description says NOTHING about it being one volume of a complex work. It is one volume, not the complete work, I was embarrassed to discover from my mom. Where is the rest of the work? NOT AVAILABLE? Available for an additional [exorbitant] sum? If it had been an order for myself, I would return, but my mom is 3,000 miles away and I do not want to add insult to injury by asking her to pack and return ship, so injustice has been rewarded.	0
As a nonfiction and disaster buff, of course this book caught my eye. This amazing story of survival was made all the better by Philbrick's skill at story-telling. The book is never dull. And he not only describes the shipwreck, but the whaling business and it's culture in detail. With frequent allusions to other shipwrecks and disasters, this story has only piqued my interest.	1
"""The Magic Barrel"" was a collection of stories that intrigued me, if only for the whimsical sounding name. I was disappointed, however, to find that the stories themselves were themselves not whimsical in the least. Malamud has created a world where paranoia is abundant, and worse, where poor, lackadaisical decisions are abound equally. There are no winners in any of Malamuds stories. I found myself becoming angry at the characters, for the way in which they responded to conflicts was alarmingly pathetic. His character development is strong, however, and I did enjoy maybe one or two of the stories until I found the ending rather dreary. If a literary work is ""sad,"" that is not a deterrant for me. Malamud's characters, on the other hand, are hopeless. I can't seem to enjoy reading about people who operate in such ways."	0
This to me is the realistic view of the animals coming to Noah before the Ark was finished. Noah, his family and the animals became acquainted with each other before the flood. This is beautiful.	1
This may be a good book on military history. I am not a military historian, so I cannot attest to how sound Markham's research into that subject is. Just know what you are buying. There is almost nothing here about Napoleon as a person, not compared to most other biographies. And the social context which gave rise to Napoleon is not really explored here. I find the first two chapters of the book that deal with Napoleon's genealogy and his early years interesting and well-written. After that the book got too dense and the writing style rather pedestrian. Everything beyond the first chapter of the book is written for a specialist (a scholar who focuses on the 19th century or on military history). At the time of the publication the book received such glowing reviews that I cannot help but wonder what I missed here.	0
"There are very few albums where every song is one that I want to listen to over and over. Clay's voice is beautiful and he should have many hits from this CD. ""Touch"" is amazing."	1
Great Book! Keeps you focused and entertained. Classic ending, Climax of the story is thrilling, hits you when you least expected it..Great Plot, Great Character descriptions, you feel in touch with the characters and feel their every emotion! A Must Read! I couldn't stop reading...You TOO will enjoy it!	1
If you're looking for some insights into fashion and/or the fashion world, look else where. I thought I'd gain some insights to the world of fashion (an area of life that I'm not famailiar with) but I was very disappointed. Nothing but nothing in this book had to do with fashion, the fashion business, nor the intellectual exercise that goes into fashion. This was simply the rambling lifetime memories of a well respected player from the fashion field. Childhood, young adult, married, Europe, here, there, everywhere... if you like name dropping (and I admit she did drop some impressive names) - this book is for you. If you're looking for some insights into fashion and/or the fashion world, look else where.	0
"My three sons were all delighted by this book when they were toddlers and preschoolers. It is so much fun to read together, with the young child laughing as they turn the page and discover where the movable spider has hidden (for example, they lift the flap of the toilet lid and there's the spider with the words, ""Silly Spider, what are you doing there!?!"").I wish that they would bring this book back into print. Because it was one of our favorites, I had wanted to give a copy as a gift to my friends and nieces for their own children. But it's not available :-( Please bring Silly Spider back so that more young children can enjoy his silly adventures."	1
"This was not a good first book to learn SNMP, the basic definitions are poor, leading to confusion. As an example, the definition of a subtype I found in another text (a subset of the value set for a type) was quite clear, then I checked the Simple definition of subtype and found its was useful to ""refine the semantics"" of a ""data object"" and that ""it may be useful to create a new data type for strings using other repertoires, such as ASCII"". The author also notes that the ""ASN.1 rules for subtyping are long and complex"". (p 34-35). Hello? This book may be useful as a reference after reading other, better written introductions, but avoid it if you are new to SNMP. Also, I recommend that the novice learn ASN.1 first, rather than alsong with SNMP in a combined text. Also, SNMPv2 has yet to catch on, the Simple book focuses primarily on this version, not of much interest if you are working with version 1."	0
This is an insipid, uninspired, pointless, maudlin, unprovocative, boring, and poorly written travesty that never would have been published if the author hadn't been famous. Save your money. (It might be useful for insomniacs, I must admit.)	0

I bought this for my four year old he in between beds and wanted something temp since we are planning to move to another state and didn't want to by a bed we would have to move so decided to by this. within a week had a first hole patch everything fine two week later another leak think it coming from where the motor is..we had a queen size on from same brand it that happen to that one as well. The one without the built in motor never had an issue with which is what we are using now. I also don't like the top it not comfortable with the humps.	0
I think this is the best Sea & Cake album so far. Song for song, this stands up against any of their previous albums, and it's their most cohesive album to date as well. The music could be described as latin jazz played by musicians with a rock background, or as rock music heavily informed by jazz influences. There are touches of synthesizers, there are breezes of strings, the guitars dance around each other, the drums create rhythms that are part latin, part kraut rock, while the bass anchors the entire album, creating a foundation (a mobile dynamic foundation) for the other players to weave their sounds around.	1
These are not HID. One star for false advertising. Persons unfamiliar with headlight technology are confused my this type of misinformation. It is typical for non-HID lamps to advertise that they have Xenon gas and that is confusing enough (although technically true). But to call these lights HID is just plain inaccurate and misleading.	0
I have been using Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers diapers and now that my daughter is 6 months old I decided I would try and save some money given her skin may not be as sensitive. The first week in using the Pampers Baby Dry diapers she went wet through it overnight (which she has never done so I assume the absorbency is not as good) and on a different occasion the blue dye on the diaper came off on her skin!! The blue dye coming off on her was the most disappointing. I was so shocked by the difference in quality of this product. I will never use Pampers Baby Dry again and will be going back to Pampers Sensitive Swaddlers its worth the extra $16/month!	0
"This is the only 12-cup thermal carafe coffee maker I've been able to find, and it's at a decent price. So what's the problem? The machine is supremely finicky about: 1) placement of the filter holder in the basket; 2) closing the swinging basket against the main unit; and 3) placement of the carafe beneath the basket. It's surprisingly easy to get any of those three just slightly wrong, and easy to miss that they aren't quite square. And the result if ANY of the three ""moving parts"" is even minutely ""off"" is coffee all over your counter and floor. We've owned the machine for seven or eight months, and manage to wash the floor with Starbucks at least once a month - and we're forewarned and pretty careful! Too bad - it makes good coffee but who wants to slurp it off the tile?"	0
"I am a huge fan of Tolkein books and lord of the rings especially. This was actually a pretty fun game for a while, I can't complain, I bought it in a bargain bin for $5 bucks, and I was thinking ""What am I going to lose?"" I lost 5 bucks and I want it back. I liked how it had aspects of the books instead of the movies in them, like Tom Bombadil and such. I would have more stars for it (1, mayyybe 2) if I didn't get stuck in Rivendell. I think I got Gimili's axe a step ahead of when I was supposed to and when I talk to him he says he needs it. Game over. There is nothing I can do to progress. And what really sucks is that I saved it before I knew that I was stuck. So its either spend another 3-5 hours replaying it and getting back to that part to progress, or quitting. I think I'll just quit and maybe sell it for a buck on Amazon."	0
I got this HD-DVD from this website for like 13 bucks and watch the Batman Begins on my add-on 360 HD-DVD drive, the picture are amazing on my Optoma HD70 on my 25 ft wall, amazing detail and so ALIVE! The story is almost perfect, but what is missing is Danny Elfman music and I missed the tone of Batman Return which is one of the top 2 batman movie ever filmed. Yes, I mean Batman Return and Batman Begins... they're both amaziong and well-made movie. I can't wait to get the rest of the other batman movies on HD-DVD!	1
Excellent album, a masterpiece of this guys (and the shipping was absolutely great). A must in every music collection.	1
If you are looking for a french romantic film, this is not it! Wow, a real downer, and quite perverse. If you like true tragedies, then I think it would be a good film. The acting is quite good. At one point the main character tries to make love to her own mother. The whole movie was just too disturbing for me.	0
It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too.	1
Gave it 4 stars because it doesnt have any identifying marks to indicate a brand, otherwise, for the price you couldnt do better any where else.It bolted up almost perfectly, had to pull one corner slightly to line up with the mounting hole, but this was not hard to solve.Packaging was a little scanty for a heavy product, but again, for the low price it came in great condition, just a few scratches because the box was broken in a few places. But this product is going under my car, not to be seen and polished.Very good value, I would recomend this to anyone who is in the market for an inexpensive hitch receiver.	1
I'm a long-time Zane Grey fan and thought I'd read all his Westerns, but apparently I'd missed this one. While I agree with the other reviewers about his compelling descriptions of the West and its beauty, overall I found the story both boring and didactic. Missing were the memorable characters of many other of his books; missing also was the kind of action that makes it hard to put my Kindle down. I'm afraid that I can give it only two stars.	0
I purchased 2 of them for my nephews so that they don't fight with one another. My only complain is the flashlight, very poor quality. The light keeps going off and on, even with a new battery. I think it's a connection problem. Aside from that... my nephews love them.	1
Just ask questions and give answers. If you don't already know the subject matter asking questions does not tutor you.	0
Ransom by far is my favorite of all Julie Garwood's Scottish series. She uses Broderick as the main character and his personality matches Gillian's perfectly. I was happy to revisit the characters of Judith and Iain again.	1
I have owned for the past 2 years the 1753 Whistler. The 1773 I just purchased gives numerous false alarms, during an alarm, the unit jumps between K and KA band voice warnings, and this is in the most filtered City 2 mode. I can't say I recommend this unit. Although this model was more expensive than most others I have seen and used, it is not as good a performer.	0
its very bad diaper from Pampers.. It wont keep dry more than 2 hours.. during night i have to change my kids diaper 3 times.. thats being very worst thing.i bought new diaper for my kid.. i stop using this diaper.. i am totally unhappy with this pamper product.	0
This timer is AWESOME! It's very easy to install, and because it operates on a 9 volt battery, I won't hafta replace as often as my old timer that used 3 AAs	1
"I regard this movie as the epitome of a bad ""stupid"" movie. Not only is the plot predictable, but the characters are irritating and the script perpetuates many of the stereotypes of the time. For instance, Rochester, the black man, is the only one stupid enough to fall down the secret passage chair not once but twice, and the dim-witted society lady knocks on the door herself and says, ""Come in."" We could only wish that intelligence would ""come in""to this movie."	0
My wife purchased this game for my B-day. So far, I really like the game.I like playing Warcraft, Starcraft, and C&C series. However, I was getting bored of managing resources (e.g. gold, timber, food)I was looking for a game with more strategy rather than resource building.I remember the first time I played Myth and I like the concept of the game. Praetorian is a mixture of Myth and Warcraft. There is less resource managment and more strategy on fighting. Praetorians' graphics, sounds and game play is top notch.	1
I would give this Sherlock Holmes story 5 stars, the low rating is due to the poor Kindle formatting. I know it is free but there are substantial passages missing... parts that are very important to the story... such as the actual legend of the Hound of the Baskerville. If you are truly interested in reading this story, there is a version that is only $1 to download and is complete.	0
The book is very easy, straight-forward reading; I found the instructions, suggestions, and explanations to be clear and concise. What once seemed like a daunting task actually turned out to be a fun, simple, and manageable project thanks to the book, charts, and tools; it really is as easy as 1, 2, 3...(1) measure the angle, (2) set your miter, and (3) make the cut! Worth every penny and then some! I'm looking forward to my next project already!	1
Be careful when ordering this product. I do not know the quality of this item because I never got it. I've waited over a month to receive it but I never did. Amazon had to cancel the purchase. Beware when you order this item that it might come late, if it comes at all.	0
Batman, like the Phoenix, has risen from the ashes and has returned with 'Batman Begins'. This movie is truly amazing and is never dull. I have seen this film many times and it is just as fresh and just as exciting as it was when I watched it for the first time.Christian Bale has taken Batman and made it his own. I didn't think anyone could top Michael Keaton's performance as the dark knight, but I was wrong. The entire film in itself is truly unbelievable. I wasn't that big of a fan of Ra's Al Ghoul before this movie, but he was the best villain for it. Cillian Murphey was also the perfect choice for Scarecrow. Overall, everyone was right for who they portrayed in the movie.Let's not forget the locations that we see in this movie. All truly breath taking. Batman fans rejoice! This is a movie that is not something you should miss. Every single person owes it to themselves to see this movie. One of the best movies of last year.	1
I'm a fan of Ian Richardson's from the FU series and when I saw tapes were finally available of him doing Sherlock Holmes I immediately bought them. They're AWFUL. He doesn't play Holmes well at all and the action in them is slow and stagey. Even the damn credits take too long to roll at the beginning. Mothers, tell your children not to do what I have done--SAVE YOUR MONEY and watch Jeremy Brett instead. Richardson seems like a natural for this role, but it's a disappointment.	0
After the first 30 minutes of senseless violence and stilted dialogue I could not bear to watch the rest of this film.	0
"I caught glimpses of this on cable as a kid, and those parts interspersed with ominous warnings from adults about this movie, have driven it to legendary status within my brain.I imagine scenes in my head now that aren't actually in the movie because Polanski is so masterful at suggesting more than is actually on the screen. This movie, along with Chinatown, shows Polanski is at his most suggestive and subtle.He absolutely reaches the ideal that Hemingway talked about with ""90% of the story submerged beneath the surface""--only Polanski does it on film in a way that no one else has done before or since.Hail Satan!Err..Hail Polanski!"	1
Nothing I can write about this book can capture how I feel about it. Quite simply, it was like finding a buried treasure in my parents' basement.I usually prefer books like The Da Vinci Code, Rule of Four or anything by Nelson DeMille, but reading Clan of the Cave Bear has opened a new door for me and I, having never read these books before, feel so fortunate that I can look forward to many, many months of satisfying reading!I will read the entire series!	1
The Bottom Line:Without question the best horror film to come out in the last decade (not that it's had much competition), The Descent takes a little time to develop an interesting (and all female) group of friends before plunging them into a situation that would be terrifying enough even if there weren't creatures to worry about; if you like horror and haven't seen this film then you should be ashamed.Note: Please watch the unrated version/Director's cut for a much better ending	1
I couldn't wait to read the first of the Foundation novels, having got such great reviews, and having heard that it's been such an inspiration to so many other sci-fi authors. But I could barely finish it. The book is flat-out boring. There is no action, choosing rather to focus mostly on matters of political intrigue. If you like watching CSPAN, then you'll love this book.There is also no continuity of storyline or characters. The book constantly jumps ahead in time right about the time you've wrapped your head around the current characters and plot.It's like a set of boring short stories, loosely stitched together with an single underlying theme.	0
Excellent overview of the history of Paganism. The paperback is in horrible fine print, though. This should be on every bookshelf, as it dispells myths while humanizing the myth makers.	1
the strips will not hold up to the weight, it torn on the first use. Do not order this product!!	0
"This game is a lot of fun. I love the smart aleck way it talks to me. Sometimes I stump it. Often the challenge is, ""how well did I answer the questions?"" Sometimes I replay the game answering questions differently and the ""toy"" finally gets it right. Fun on many levels. AND...a great gift. I've given 3 so far."	1
These eMarker guys are out of business, so not sure if this thing even works any longer.	0
This movie is hard to follow. But, the action is terrific. I think it should have been longer to explain some of the story. I recommend this film for its incredible action and quick pace. This movie has it all except a cohesive storyline. But, that probably adds to the charm of the film. Other plotless films turn out boring, but this one is throughly entertaining.	1
Unlike the other reviewers, i'll compare the two best B-ball game on the market for ya. I got BOTH!GRaphic-NBA2003 had better graphics, smoother movement and brighter textures.Sound-NBA2k3, cuz of ESPN!!!Value-2k3 hands down. I don't know why... but it last longer. and Online Play nuff said....Gameplay- 2003 is more casual friendly, which means even if you're not into Basketball you could still find some fun here. And with their innovative Freestyle right joystick control, its deffinitly funner.While 2003 could be funner for a shorter amount of time, 2k3 is the real winner if you took your time for Seasons.... Which one's better is really a matter of taste.	1
I personally like the control that the Zen Xtra gives you in organizing and classifying your music. It also creates playlists on the go for you (combining tracks by the same Artist, the same album, or same genre) for easy playback retrieval.The software that it comes with, Creative MediaSource, is great also, however may be a little complicated for new computer users. It lets you edit all track information (Artist, genre, album, track #) regardless of what ID3 tags were used when recording.Also do I need to remind you of the removable battery. Poor iPod users have to shell out almost $100 to get their battery serviced/replaced when its dead. Also you can store, data files, video files, etc. on the Zen Xtra (it's a portable hard drive also)The only negative is the buttons on the case are oddly positioned.Overall I don't recommend this item for newbies. But if you want great control and organization over your MP3s, this is definitely the player for you!!!	1
I expected much more from this book. It started out interesting enough but, seemed to drag on and on. In the end it was depressing and a little confusing. I like a fiction book to be entertaining and thought provoking; with a point, I did not at all enjoy this book.	0
Though not a fan of his astrological writings for Vanity Fair, this book is mind-blowing. I have had it for over 20 years (even had it rebound at Kinkos). It has truly helped me reinterpret the motivation of countless people in my life in a way that's helped me improve those relationships. It's a book like no other in the way it helps me make sense of other people's actions by understanding their point of view (haven't read his new book yet).	1
This was one of the best movies I've ever seen. It made Padre Pio very real, his life, dedication and suffering. It was a lengthy film but worth ever minute. I highly recommend it to any one at all intersted in the mystical side of our saints and the Church.	1
As I didn't liked the story at all I cant say lots of things about it but if I had to rewrite the book, I would do it in modern English. Old Englih is one of the reasons I didn't liked the book. Another reason is that is a very predictable story and it has only 2 themes: Romeo and Juliet's love and the war between their families. For me Romeo is the worst character because he only thinks about Juliet and kissing her.These and much more are the reasons of why I didn't liked the story	0
If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!	0
"Re-releasing this series with a new illustrator was a terrible idea and, frankly, completely missing the point of the originals. The stories themselves are a collection of sleepover tales and urban legends which, when taken alone, aren't particularly frightening. For those of us who enjoy this series, it was the original illustrations from the twisted mind of Stephen Gammell that made these ""Scary Stories"" truly scary; without them, the book is laughable. Helquist may be a talented enough artist, but he can't hope to duplicate the underlying terror of Gammell's illustrations."	0
"Cream/ Fresh Cream (DCC Gold Disk - 13 tracks): Fresh Cream is a great album. The original U.S. release, however, did not include the song ""Spoonful"", so my advice is to find a version of the album that at least includes that great song. The Gold disk has the 10 cuts from the U.S. release plus ""Spoonful"", ""Wrapping Paper"", and ""The Coffee Song"". As the Gold disk has become SO expensive recently, I would advise a different version of the CD but, as said before, make sure you get one with ""Spoonful"" (in truth, `Wrapping Paper"" and ""The Coffee Song"" are not that necessary to own)."	1
After Shogun one would expect much better. Compared with Shogun, King Rat is rather 2D. The plot is not as engrossing. I think readers will have a difficult time getting into the story. The ending is somewhat predictable (what do YOU think happens to all the prisoners?)and there are many things that are never explained (who is the informant that knew about the radio? ). On the whole an entertaining book, but it moves slowly and doesnt go anywhere (how exciting can life in a prison be anyway? :P )	0
"This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed."	0
These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise. I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems. I look forward to your reply.	0
"My aunt persuaded me to read this book. I am not a big fan of Romance but I gave it a try. Did this book change my mind about this geanre? No, not really. The characters seem very undeveloped - the author told us upfront what they thought and felt rather than letting them convey it through their actions. Brodick is very rude and primitive. All that comes to mind is that he talks ""gruffly"" - that word was used 98 times to describe him (and that is only where I bothered to count). As for poor Gillian, she is just too irritating even to talk about. To wrap it all up -- NOT an interesting read. (Sorry Gulie Garwood..)"	0
I really liked this book because I like animals, and I really do want to be a veteranarian! READ THIS BOOK!!!	1
"I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."	1
I can tell you that I used to have a small smart device called the iTag from Xenote and that worked VERY well. Plus..........it was FREE!! I used to use it in the Bay Area and the selection of the radios was great, the Web site very easy to navigate on. I could even get my info in real time which was great. Unfortunately, this start-up, as many others, had to close doors for the lack of $.... Too bad that those guys at Sony have too much money but do not care enough about their customers to launch a decent product... After the PlayStation 2 fiasco launch, they keep going on...... :-(	0
"Stop buying Clay's fame!!!!!This CD is definitely not 5 stars! L:ike someone said earlier, read the musiccritics reviews on it before you purchase.Whoever bought 10 copies of thisCD is a FOOL and an idiot! Actually that would make the whole so called ""Clay nation"" who are all purchasing multiple copies of it in their sick campaign to buy Clay his fame. Where is your trust in histalent? Please leave him alone and purchase the CD theway normal fans would buy for their favorite artist and see what happens?You are only hurting him, making him think that he's more than he is and franklyit's embarrassing. To see him strutting and stooping and straining and switching the mike from hand to hand trying to work up some feeling to the songs. lol!it's a big jokein our house. We actually had a party too laughing at this guy.I love Justin Timberlake, Beyonce and a few others, but to purchase more than one or two copies of their CD is totally rediculous! Stop buying Clays way to the top! LEAVE HIM ALONE!!!!"	0
"Pampers are good quality, pretty good protection against blowouts, etc. But we have two complaints. First of all, there's a mesh on the inside that sticks to baby's bottom pretty consistently. Worse, for us, the ""dry"" part is because of chemicals in the diaper, which caused our baby to develop red, rashy skin very quickly. We've since read that this is a common issue with Pampers, especially ""dry max"". Overall, I would not recommend these to a friend. Huggies and others have worked far better for us."	0
The proof of a book on health issues is in the results it gets you, and it's very hard to argue with the results I've gotten from following Dr. Bernstein's plan. Many others have reviewed this book more capably than I can, but let me just say that after a few months of following Dr. B's diet, I've lost 50 lbs., gotten normal blood sugars, and feel better than I've felt in years. Highly recommended!	1
I picked up this book because I was just in need of something to read. Once I began, I could not put it down! Farenheit 451 is set in a not so far away distopian future where media rules and books are illegal. In this place, firemen start fires on books rather than put fires out. Guy Montag is fireman who begins to see the truth in books. When this is discovered though, he has to run for his life. This is a great book for pretty much everyone, but there is aare heavy phycological thoughs throughout the whole book, and sparce mild language. Overall, if you want a great book to read, choode this!	1

Works great, looks more classy than the plain white ones for curtain hanging and it's strong enough to hold curtains. The end piece was a lot smaller than I thought. I thought it would be maybe 2.5 inches in diameter, but it's only about 1. (I didn't measure it.)	1

"Ever wonder ""What If""? What if you had done things just a little differently, or what if you had done it a second earlier? What would the outcome be? How would it change? Find out just how much change there can be in Run Lola Run, where our heroine relives the same high-paced, action packed 20 minutes three times, each with a different outcome. Awesome heavy German dance music - great soundtrack. Available in both English dubbed, and original German format with subtitles. I love this movie!"	1
This MP3 player served me well for two years until (because of my clumsiness) I broke it. It worked beautifully, able to play both MP3 and WMA files with ease. Loading files onto the player was a breeze, as was initial setup of the software. The headphones that it comes with are comfortable and have a good amount of volume capability. A great MP3 player, I'm now trying to find a replacement but am finding it difficult to find another that measures up. I miss you, my iPAQ.	1
"This side story is actually an anthology of semi related tales. It is tedious, boring and an absolute mess. Unless you have a passion for the minutiea of 17th century German government this is a waste of time. I have enjoyed the other books very much but this one is so disjointed that it barely makes sense.I would suggest skipping this one and waiting for the ""real"" book to come about the Baltic War."	0
As I read these reviews, I am perplexed by the people who complain that Batman Begins is inconsistent with the original source material, meaning the first Tim Burton film. As if Tim Burton invented Batman and his version is the one to respect.The Burton film was rife with inconsistencies in relation to the true origin of Batman. The Joker did not kill Bruce Wayne's parents. Commissioner Gordon did play a crucial role in Batman's development.Batman Begins is the truest version of the Batman legend and is not meant to be considered as a part of the previous films canon. It is the beginning of a whole new telling of the story.	1
I recall this recording on LP in the early fifties. It conveys the humour and genius of Mozart with great singers although other than Steber they were not previously identified with WM.	1
"Radom thoughts:1. While liking the general concept of Batman, I don't like the Dark Knight persona.2. This movie seems to be a prequeal for all the earlier films. It tells the gripping story of Bruce Wayne in a unuiqe and emotional way.3. Great actors, great props, great music, great special effects.4 The plot line is scary though, espeacially Dr. Crane's mask.5. A few suprises in this one: Wayne Manor burning down and Bruce's suppossed ""mentor"" turning out to be a bad guy.6. The only thing that saves this movie are the actors and the DVD's special features. I guess I'll have to investigate the Dark Knight persona a little more to appriciate it. I'd consider seeing another Batman movie as long as Christian Bale keeps the lead role."	0
Jean Goldkette should be mentioned along with Paul Whiteman when people talk about the great white jazz bands of the 1920s. Besides his exciting arrangements, he was an innovator. When other bands used a tuba, Goldkette use a bass. And while other bands used a banjo, Goldkette had a guitar player. Another reason Goldkette's arrangement are recognizable: jazz violin solos. Many bands simply had the violinist in the background playing the main melody. Goldkette had Joe Venuti fiddling away. The only drawback to this recording is the haphazard use of noise reduction. Sometimes it's not there, other times it's in full force, and that causes a distraction from the great music.	1
Ditto ats27. Clay's voice is indeed beautiful, and he has magnificent range for lead vocals in a broadway musical, or for easy listening. Tone him down, he is not a pop singer. Stop trying to make him something that he is not. Clay, Harry Connick Jr. did a magnificent job just being himself, and so will you. That is, once you realize who you really are musically.	0
Exactly what I needed, for a fraction of the price. One warning: didn't come with the bolts needed to attach it, so make sure you save these off of the old mirror (I had, so it wasn't a problem).	1
I'm very disappointed with this book. Very vague and broad examples and not a lot of the nuts and bolts of success. Jennifer Kushell is the self crowned princess of the young entrepreneurial spirit. She claims to have launched successfull business ventures but never elaborates anywhere in her books or websites and instead offers page after page of fluff and filler on how to get ahead. After wasting my time with this book and two of her other books, I'd be skeptical of allowing her to run a lemonade stand. Please save your time and money. There are many better choices by PROVEN success stories. Multiple streams of Income by Robert Allen and How to Buy a Business: Entrepreneurship Through Acquisition by Richard A. Joseph are two of many that are a much better read for your time and money	0
"I have to agree with the previous reviewer. This book is more like the cliff notes to a book about men's fashion, tradition, style, etc. The other half of the book is relatively useless - unless, of course, you're a millionaire & world traveller. The prose is humorous at times becasue it's so pretentious - bordering on the effeminate a la Niles Crane. Still, there are some very imporatnt basice male fashion rules established by history and tradition, discussed in this book, which one wishes were adhered to more regularly. The first half of the book is serviceable, but not authoritative. Flusser comes off somewhat foppish and the picture of him on the dustjacket would lead me to question his taste in, if nothing else, haircuts! I would consider a better book, with far more lavish detail and illustrations to be ""Gentlemen : A Timeless Fashion"", only recently published."	0
"Having greatly enjoyed ""Deja Dead,"" I really looked to Death Du Jour. Unfortunately it is a complete disappointment. I found the story overy contrived and coincidental. The characters were wooden. Frankly, the whole thing seemed like a bad movie where no one had the courage to ask ""why, this story."" In summary, don't bother with this lousy novel."	0
Great timer for dedicated appliance circuit. It has a high wattage rating for the large A/C's but does use the plug that has one prong sideways. The only thing i wish it had was more setting tabs so i could have more cycles, it comes with 2 sets of tabs.	1
This is a wonderful book for anyone who loves their dogs as children. I bought one for our 3 year old adopted beagle, and am getting one for our daugher-in-law's birthday for their rottie. You can personalize it as you wish, and I have included comic clippings (Marmaduke, Mutts, etc.) that are appropriate along with the photos and have created the beginning of a great book for my best friend that I will keep forever.	1
"I really Like This CD because I like this kind of ""Teen Music"". It seems Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera with a bad day and Enrique Iglesias... Its Just a GOOD CD.ME PIERDO JUNTO A TI: A VERY GOOD song, I love it. (9/10)VAS A VOLVERME LOCA: Good, but not the best from the CD. (7/10)LA LECCI√ìN: One of the best songs.

These Carters baby albums are very cute, high quality, and easy to use. They have pockets for the photos rather than those electrostatic pages which makes them far easier to use (in my opinion). They also have space to write notes next to each photo. We liked the one we got for our daughter so much, we bought another when we had our son.	1
I did not receive this one but did get the other two games that supposedly came in the same package weird, I'll keep searching for the lost artifact, but who knows what really happened.	0
Whoa! This movie literally took my breath away. Its fast paced the whole time never letting up. The editing is brilliant and the cinematography is amazing. Forget the VHS get the DVD its cheaper and has extra scenes and interviews. The plot is like nothing ive ever seen before. Buy this and you won't regret it.	1
I have ordered this DVD four times. Picture is fine, music is fine, subtitles are fine BUT none of the received DVD has french dialogs/ actors' voices. Does somebody else have the same experience??Steve	0
"There is no evidence of Clay's soul in this collection of songs, which was such a part of his performances on American Idol. This recording is a ""paint-by-numbers"" pop CD that is utterly boring and a huge disappointment. Clay has been stripped of his ""soul"" in this CD. His talents are completely lost on this endeavor and he is capable of truly fantastic performances."	0
Is a great bed for the money!!.our son loves it!!! Easy directions for assembly and seems durable so far. Bed time is not a problem in our house!	1
Asimov wrapped up the Foundation/Robot/Empire saga quite well in Foundation and Earth. I must admit I was a bit confused by the book as I read the Foundation series starting with Foundation before I read any of the Robot/Empire Novels or even Prelude to Foundation or Forward the Foundation. Despite my confusion, I was impressed with the book even then.	1
I read this book when I was 12 years old, and it changed my life. I realized that I was not alone in the world when I read about Francie who loved her alcoholic father and had to cope with her mother, who had been so hurt by her father's alcoholism that she was unable to be the mother Francie needed, hard as she tried. Instead, her mother had to figure out how to keep her family together, always a tough job for the non-alcoholic parent.I admired Francie so much, and she inspired me to be strong, courageous, kind, creative, and loving.I am 62 years old now, 50 years after reading A Tree Grows in Brooklyn for the first time, which I re-read every couple of years, and I still remember the thrill I felt as I learned that there were other girls who faced the same challenges that I had to face when I was 12. Oh, and I was born in Brooklyn too!St. James Place	1
I bought this to replace my 'falling apart' original charger. Worked like a charm for 3 months, then I found my computer dying on me. The charging signal would change frequently from charging to not etc.. I ordered a new battery, as i thought it was on its way out. I downloaded coconutbattery, and that explained all i needed it to. It showed the charger as connected, BUT not charging. I scrounged up my old charger, hooked it up, and sure enough, connected AND charging. It is without a doubt the macally charger. So i recommend it if you only plan on using it for 3 months or less. So not only am I out a charger, i ordered a battery for no reason.	0
I actually purchased this book a few years ago. As a high school student into Swedish culture, I bought this book because it looked fun and easy to read. I was very impressed with this pocket sized text.I felt as though I started learning Swedish right away. I learned my phone number, days of the week and greetings. I taught my friends. They all borrowed the book.I went to Sweden and Finland about a year later. I found it useful. It is not the be all and end all of the Swedish language by any means, but I loved it. I do wish it had an audio tape.I lost the book recently and I have decided to repurchase the same book because I have found none better for the price and quick information it provided.	1
"I have to admit that ""Be Not Nobody"" was not my favorite CD by far. Even though it had some catchy tunes. When I found out that Vanessa Carlton had a new CD I new I needed to get it... Little did I know how amazing it would be. She has shown so much growth since her first album, and I hope that this gets her through the ""sophomore jinx"" as they say... and if it doesn't then people don't know what they're missing. Excellent Vanessa, just amazing. Thanks so much for making great music!"	1
There are 2 good things in this movie-(1) Bruce Dern, who plays the groundskeeper and who, in about 3 lines and 20 seconds, out-acts everyone else in the film, even though they get hours. Bruce Dern should have been the star of this film. He's got more talent in his left nostril than the rest of the cast have in their whole bodies. He's of the old school like Donald Sutherland, and he is squandered in this film. The director is like a prospector who puts the mud in his pocket and leaves the gold behind.(2) The mansion itself, which is extraordinarily beautiful, but probably only a bunch of sets. Still, it's lovely.Nothing else in this movie is remotely interesting or frightening. The screenplay reads as if it were written by a junior high student.	0
If you are new to Corvus Corax, this is an excellent compilation cd to add to your music collection. In addition, expose yourself to some of their excellent concert dvd recordings. The combined audio and visual is awesome.	1
My ten month old got this as a gift and loves it! Many pop up toys are difficult for very young children to use. The buttons on this toy are easy to push and knobs easy to turn. He was frustrated by his other pop up toy that he could rarely get to work with his tiny hands. This allows his cognitive abilities to develop even before his fine motor skills would be ready to use other toys.	1
Great movie. just needed a plot, a script, some acting, some directing, etc. However, seeing those planes fly was nice.	0
"This is an excellent album and the music has surpassed my expectations of Clay Aiken. He gives out his heart and soul in each one the songs. This is one album that can put a smile on my face and it gives me joy. It is fun and spirit lifting to listen to this album, ""Measure Of A Man."" ""Invisible"" is my favorite with many others are running a close second. None are lower than a third place finish. I like it better and better each time I listen to it."	1
Couldn't watch more than 30 minutes. The acting, the plot, everything... completely just... BAD. Why do people enjoy this movie?	0
I was lucky enough to discover this gem two years ago. I'd just gotten braces, so having a great new book to read was a small comfort. The story is about a misfit named Patty. Her parents mistreat her, and the only sources of love are her grandparents, her housekeeper Ruth, and a German soldier called Anton. Although she's Jewish, Patty loves Anton dearly and hides him in her hangout over the garage. Against her will, she must let him go. The ending was a cliffhanger and paves the way for a great sequel(check out the reviews to see if Mrs. Greene delivered). I identified with Patty because I'm an outcast too. She was so brave and precocious for a twelve-year-old. She willingly accepted the consequences for her actions. The sacrificial love between her and Anton was so beautiful. Ruth was wonderful also. I highly reccomend this, and one can't say that about every book.	1
"It is said that George Orwell lifted some material for ""1984"" from this book, and one can truly see the parallels. ""We"" is a masterpiece; though not always as involving as ""1984"", it is well constructed and powerful. A fairly quick read, ""We"" will keep you interested and leave you with an interesting literary history lesson."	1
After watching a few of the author's videos, it was obvious he knows what he is talking about. Unfortunately, the book is filled with simple grammatical errors, repeated sentences and out of order pages! Even if you overlook the printing issues, you won't find much content. The majority of the information is common sense. It hardly lives up to being a comprehensive guide. It's like they published the first draft of a basic safety lecture. The chapters might pass as blog posts but I expect a higher standard when you print a book. I am considering returning it. Hopefully, the author will write a decent second edition in the future.	0
I was very happy with my Sansa View, until all of a sudden my micro SD chip was missing. I couldn't imagine someone stealing just a chip, but then when I tried to put a new one in, I noticed it would only be installed for a second or two before the spring inside the unit would expel the chip. It would actually launch it up 4-6 inches! So now I know my original chip is somewhere at the gym, certainly vacuumed up by now.It's a great player, but check to make sure your SD card doesn't come out too easily or just send it back!	0
"This soundtrack is one of the best classic television scores I have heard. It contains such classic tracks heard on the A Team as ""move sucka"" and ""taxi chase"". This is just great music and brings back memories of Mr. T, Hanibal and the A Team. It makes me want to get out in my 1982 Custom GMC Black Van, drink Milk, go to the youth center to hang out with the kids, or throw people. So quit yo jibba jabba and buy this sountrack foo'"	1
As much as I love The Untouchables and was dying for someone to put all their classics to CD, this is not what I thought I'd be typing here. Cherry Red's remastering has terrible sound quality. Compared to the original vinyls, it sounds like you're listeing to these songs through giant ear muffs. None of the edge and liveliness, neither the great guitar kicks nor the low beaty thumps, that IS the distinct Untouchable sound gets conveyed here.	0
Even though I am an atheist/agnostic I still appreciated this book for what it was... funny. I particulary liked the philosophers. But the greatest character had to be Om.	1
This work is an enthusiastic encouragement and guidebook for charismatic renewal among Lutherans. However, it offers some dangerous theology. For example, it suggests that it's okay to make mistakes when first trying to prophesy--that everybody needs practice. However, this is contrary to Scripture. God takes false prophecy very seriously, but unfortunately Mr. Christenson does not.	0
200-300 worddI really liked this book because of Hester. She was a protagonist who refused to obey by socety's rules. She is a role model for women who wish to be free. Sure, she made a mistake. But, don't we all? Adultery is not right, but we learn from mistakes.I really liked to read about the time period because it was so different from our own. It is hard to believe that Hawthorne was only a writer for his time period.	1
This is a fantastic diaper. It can do what it says-- stand up to a 12 hours of peeing overnight. It handles big bowel movements well. It's never leaked. My baby has not had any kind of reaction to the diaper. The only reason I give this diaper 4 stars is because Luvs does the same thing for much cheaper-- in this case about $15 cheaper for the same amount of diapers. Luvs does have a powder sent which I would not prefer if money were no object, however it's not too strong and is worth it to save that amount of money per box.	1
This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service.	1
This book has greatly inspired me to trust God in greater ways even in the details of life- concerning any needs or problems. It challenges me to reach out to others and pray confidently for them as well. I want these truths from God's word to penetrate my mind and soul till I am consistently walking in them and experiencing God's powerful presence in new ways.	1
I play Hand and Foot every other week and the four of us love using these. You get 13 cards and it is very handy to have.	1
"This book is hard for me to understand because most sentences doesn't make sense. Some does make sense but most of them no. Ray Bradbury should do more better then that. I've being forced to read this book because my 9th grade english teacher made us. When I start reading this book it is okey. When I'm on page 30 the sentence doesn't make sense. It just mostly say ""I burn bookee"". I would rather read Great Expectations instead. If you are a very good reader you may try it."	0
"I am puzzled by the acidity of the review by ""J Onyx"", who contrasts the supposedly unscholarly and ""Marxist"" authors of this collection with the scholarly ""gentleman"" Robert Bremner, who wrote various works on the history of American Philanthropy. J Onyx even speculates that these historians waited until Professor Bremner was gone before they published their writings.I was one of Professor Bremner's graduate students at Ohio State and assisted him with his revision of his classic work American Philanthropy. Bob Bremner was indeed a gentleman, and he treated other scholars with an irenic spirit even when he disagreed with them. It is impossible for me to imagine Bob Bremner being so uncharitable of other scholars as J Onyx, or engaging in such an acerbic and inaccurate misrepresentation of a work.This is an important collection of well-researched essays. Anybody interested in the role of philanthropy in American history must begin with this volume."	1
"I was not pleased with this product, the bunny ears does not reach my ""pretty bump"".....I haven't used it ever since...I bought another for $25 and it got to the work done way better than this..."	0
I was so disappointed in this album after hearing Clay's beautiful voice on American Idol. It's like the producers were trying to force Clay into some pop mold. I kept listening waiting for Clay to really let one loose and belt out a song. Didn't happen. Maybe the next album Clay can be Clay.	0
I missed a lot of the subcaptions but I think I may have understood the meaning of the file. May like it more in english.	0
"Romeo and Juliet is the first Shakespearean play I have read. I thought it was very good. It didn't have a complicated plot like other Shakespearean plays allegedly have. The language, of course, is great. I would also recommend buying this edition of the book if any, because old and archaic words and phrases are translated on every other page (this is a huge help). Shakespeare offers some good comic relief (watch for several double entendres) throughout the play which moderated the level of lament. This play shows the chaos that can result when people let their emotions overcome reason, and also what can result when you only look short term and move with so much ""haste"". After finishing the play, I realized that there were indeed only a couple of totally reasonable characters, but I'll leave that to you. I look foward to reading more of Shakespeare's plays in the near future."	1
Oh my god, this book completely sucks, I mean this book is only for people who dont like Michael Jackson, but everytime I heard this story it's completely different. If you asked me it sounds like the kids uncle is sexually attracted to the boy.And isnt it kind of weird that this mans story changes everytime he tells it. And let's be real, if a weirdo supperstar did this to your son you'd take him to court an expose him for what he is, not take a giant settlement, that only says two things. 1. money is more important then your childs well-being, 2. he really was telling the truth, he must have cut them off, cause in the book it says that the dad knew something was going on, but he didnt do anything, he only chose to do something when Michael cut him off. Those stupid people should really plan it out the next time they try to frame a celebrity. So if your a person who enjoys reading books by closet inset case uncles and lies go on and get this book.	0
I purchased this product after all the wonderful reviews. This product is not a tutor. It ask questions and gives a short explanation of the answer, if you click on 'Explanation'. This product offers no tutoring at all.	0
This is a perfect fit to our very old record player. It was exactly as describer and works beautifully! It was shipped very fast.	1
I love it. It is thick and tight. I would buy more but it is a little too expensive. YES	1
Overall its an informative book well worth reading so I give it 5 stars. He rehashes the virgo thing to death throughout the book where I felt he could have laid that out better in 1 or 2 chapters.Also as mentioned by others below he left alot of Masonic stuff out.I recommend watching on video AMERICAS SECRET DESTINY and RIDDLES IN STONE they add and parallel this book quite well.	1
This box set is a must for people that love Toby Keith's old school music.It's got his first three albums.This is back when Toby Keith had some REALLY good songs out.I'm not much into his newer stuff at all.It sounds nothing like this.Buy this if you're a fan of his earlier music like I am.	1
Although containing 3 songs, this disc is essentially a single. 'Aquarius' is a less-polished but nearly identical to the album version from 'Music has the Right to Children.' Similarly, 'Olsen' is simply a longer rendition from the album.The only remarkable track is 'Happy Cycling,' which is a really nifty hip-hop-ish mix of the non-existant track 18 from 'Music has the Right to Children.'This disc is worth owning for 'Happy Cycling,' but try to find a cheap second-hand copy instead.	0
So disappointed - this is a travel version. It should be advertised as such. It won't last through Christmas morning if it's even looked at! I have contacted the seller as to my disappointment in hopes to obtain the real game or a full refund, I will post the result.	0
John Steinbeck uses too many cuss words in this book. I think George should have watched Lennie more so he wouldn't get into so much trouble all of the time. This book isn't really worth reading if you have a choice. It's too short and the conclusion doesn't make much sense.	0
The style of writing leads me to believe that Higgins was under pressure to churn out a book to meet some editor's deadline. There was no character development. Critical turns in the plot and action were blown through without the slightest bit of suspense. I've never read Higgins before and likely will never read him again.	0
I'm pleased with the printing, coping, and photo reproduction that HP has produced with this gem of a printer. I'm completely satisfied.	1
After falling in love with Nathaniel and Elizabeth in Into the Wilderness, I was thrilled to continue on with the series. Much to my dismay, this book did not live up to my expectations. Is it a coincidence that Gabaldon's Voyager and this book, both set mainly upon the high seas, were my least favorite out of each author's series? Hmmm. The only thing that kept me going was the promise of the third book Lake in The Clouds. The book is worth reading, don't get me wrong. Especially for those who continue on with a series. The Scotland thing seemed unnecessary to me. I would have been happier if they'd stayed in North America. Oh well. Artistic license.	0
Like other reviewers, I had the same problem with the second disc. I sent it back not ONCE but TWICE, so in all I tried 3 copies of the movie, and the second disc still would not work on any copy. This movie is great, but DO NOT BUY THIS EDITION, unless you want a DVD that doesn't work. They really need to fix this problem.	0
I first heard this CD at the Kripalu Center for Yoga and Wellness. You can't help but move your body to this CD. Most of the CD is spoken word, which I'm not entirely crazy about, but the overall feel is so visceral that I don't care if the poetry is rather eh. The background drumming and various instruments are all so perfectly interwoven. If you can''t move your body to this CD you'd better look into yourself!	1
I wanted to like this device....nice long cord .....switch on the base.....nice looking....but...It just did not get hot enough for my taste.....nice and warm but not hot....as we get older we want hotter it seems.....tried different glass and ceramic cups but sorry not hot enough.....heater is 17 watt....would like to have one at about 25 watts.	1
I was close to change my mind when I decide to purchase this shoes for my girl friend, the only issue for me was the presentation with those UGLY feets of the model. The shoes are amazing but please use other model with better feets...	1
It is extremely meandering and never seems to end. It's all about atmosphere and erotic cool and Prague, etc., but at some point a car chase would really liven things up. How about some more nipples? Throw a pie in Juliet Binoche's face? Anything! Just stop wandering around, muttering to yourself like a half-wit.Perhaps I don't get it, but I don't get syphillis either and I'm the better for it. Where's your witty rejoinder to that?!A real test of patience, this film.	0
"I bought ""The Grass Is Blue"" on the strength of the rave reviews which appear below. They didn't lie. This is one of the finest things I have ever heard, from ANY musical genre. I played it for my wife, who has zero bluegrass background, and she was just swept away by it. Every cut is strong, but the odd-numbered tracks appeal to me most, with ""Steady As the Rain"" being a particular highlight. Be warned, ""The Grass Is Blue"" may permanently hijack your musical tastes. Now when I listen to blues and rock standards that used to appeal, I just can't sustain interest for more than a few minutes. Nothing compares to the power, the purity, the soul that Dolly Parton delivers. I am compelled to go back to ""The Grass Is Blue"" for another deep drought of that cool living water. This is one album I never want to live without."	1
This book falls in the bottom five of the 28 books that I have read by Wilbur Smith. There is no review of the African continent that is so prevalent in his other books. No intermingling of the diverse peoples that populate this country that you find in most of these books. Here there is nothing here but greed and sex without purpose and typical family squabbles.To my knowledge diamond mining has never been done in this fashion in Africa.	0
I've been a long time subscriber to Men's Fitness and signed up for the Print + Kindle subscription. I have an android based tablet with the Kindle App and it would be great to read online and keep previous issues without taking up space.

I love how this product makes me look in my clothes!!! its shapes me into a perfect hourglass! i dont know if the claim that it permanantley reduces your waist after 30 days is true because i havent had it that long. my only complaints are that it is a little too short, so i still have a small bulge over the top in vthe back and i think it may be stretching out as i wear it as oppossed to it shrinking me, but overall, it is the best shapewear i have ever purchased. i love it and would recommend it to anyone.	1
I Bought this card for a third computer in my house and its the ferthest from the router and works fine.	1
If you are a John Denver fan this disk will make you cry and not for the reasons you might expect. I turned it off after 5 tracks because I couldn't bare to listen to it any more. I had the feeling that someone had rummaged through some old discarded session tapes and had played them back through a pillow. The arrangements were definitely not what I was expecting and the quality was awful. I gave this recoding 1 star but only because they wouldn't let me out of the screen without filling in that field!	0
"I could NOT put this book down!I have read it three times in total and plan to read it again. Betty Smith writes of the coming of age of one young girl in turn-of-the-century Brooklyn. Smith does well in characterizing Brooklyn and its inhabitants, from the ""fast"" but warmhearted woman to the lonely army boy.Smith accurately portrays the hopes and fears as well as the crushed dreams and ambitions of one young girl looking for happiness in a world full of nostaligia.A time that is past comes alive with glitter and grit in Smith's words."	1
Myrna Loy and William Powell had such great screen chemistry that this set of films was a no-brainer. I bought my wife The Thin Man collection previously. These films have that Loy-Powell chemistry in different settings. My wife loved it.	1
Just to start off, warmer is just what this thing does. I like my coffee just a bit hotter. This is my second warmer and it is not any better than the first one. I bought my second warmer at Wal Mart for around $5.00. Target on line list at $9.99. The major reason I use Amozon for most of my purchases is I can find things quickly and don't have to go store to store trying to find something. As I get older it is harder to get out and shop.

"The noted architect Christopher Alexander describes ""The Quality Without a Name."" It is found in art and life. We instantly recognize it, but it cannot be defined. It is when something or someone is fully alive, harmonious, true to their essential nature. D.V. has this glorious characteristic. Her evocation of the 1920's to 1960's is priceless and more valuable than any history book. She is so true to herself, honest, larger-than-life, and filled with strong opinions without being narcisisstic. D.V. shows that style comes from within and that fashion is just a tool. I adore this book."	1
If you love laughter, tears, romance, and great music, this is a great choice! A cult classic for romance fans as well as fans of the fifties era movies. A must see for anyone who enjoys a great flick. The chemistry between the entire cast is magic. And if you love a good misundertood bad boy, C. Thomas Howell is one of the best. Even though I grew up in the eighties, this movie was still quite reminicent of my own childhood. Anyone who was a kid in any era will find something to relate to in this movie. One of my faves..	1
The Bottom Line:A somewhat forgotten film whose Criterion release should heighten its exposure, Brute Force is a raw and intense film about an prison riot that belies its Hays Code era setting to deliver violence and tension throughout its running length; if you like your films rough and ruthless, get Brute Force.3.5/4	1
Wonderful book that I discovered in junior high. Several years later I bought a copy and this novel has become one of a treasured few I read again every year. The central character (indeed, practically the only character for most of the book) grows so much during her experience that you remember her life changes long after you put down the book. As always, great fast-moving, realistic storytelling from Harry Mazer.	1
This is a text book I ordered for my classes for teacher certification. This book is very easy to read, and I am really enjoying it. It presents info and then at the end of a section, recaptures the essence of the reading for you. I would suggest it for any teaching class. I am learning so much from this book. I have been buying all my text books from Amazon because they are so much cheaper, and sometimes I can get free shipping. So far, there has not been a book that I could not find here at Amazon.	1
"This set of stories is definitely among the best works of fiction ever to reach the printed page! The most important characters such as Captain America, Silver Surfer, and Thanos are handled flawlessly. The entire first five sections just keep building the suspense and you are wondering the entire time ""how are the good guys going to win?"" and we find out in the sixth. This book shows why Marvel comics are the best because we care about the characters. The book also has Captain America's defining moment: at the end of the battle only Cap stands. He walks up to the God-like Thanos. His shield is destroyed and Thanos brings his fist towards him. Captain America stands there, defiance to the last. The look in his eye, captured perfectly by Ron Lim says it all. In short, if you are a fan of comics, or even if you aren't and want to see why so many of us feel like the characters are friends and, in some cases like Captain America, even good role models, then buy this book!"	1
The mechanical switches are a wonderful way to add new fun to my son's Brio track. It seems easy for him to operate the switches and it adds a new dimension to his layouts since he now can redirect trains as they move about. They are a little pricey, but appear durable and well worth it.	1
This was an interesting and engrossing book about Greece (including its surrounding islands) which helps connect the historical world of Ancient Greece with the scenery and people found there today. (Reading it with a map or atlas handy would definitely enhance the experience).The first half retells the story of Odysseus and his journey to Troy, with a special emphasis on the sites as we know them today (great for those preparing for a trip to Greece - especially if you're interested in getting a handle on the names and significance of the various islands). The second half emphasizes personal stories of the author's own travels and visits to Greece which bring to life its land, people, personality and culture of Greece.Fascinating and enjoyable!	1
I didn't too sure about this. It was on special movie channel so I gave it a listen. All that happened were people in not many clothes (was the movie at the Beach??) looking sad most times. Also there was a hat. While I watched all I kept thinking was about other things like drinking water that were more exciting. I notice near the ending that the man in the movie was the angry man from the gangrene movie - I almost lost him because he was so different! In the other movie he was mean; here he was just bored or looked like he was looking at something very far aways. He didn't talk much but was a doctor so I guess he is smart. There is a car crash in the snow near the end, but I don't think that was a learning part. The movie is like watching the home films from vacations when you are at boring cousin house, or shows on the public channels. Drink water for more fun - or watch with pillows!!! One sleepy star this time! (wait: there are pretty girls in here, so be careful watching!)	0
The first movie in the series is good, but, Road Warrior is better. but does that mean it`s bad? Heck no! This is actually one of the best of the sci-fi genre.It`s about this guy named Max, (duh!) who gets pissed at this motorcycle gang for killing his friend and family and seeks his hellish revenge.	1
I used these as candle warmers rather than coffee mug warmers. I bought 5 of these and would turn them on probably 15-20 minutes at a time. They ended up almost exploding or busting open after a while and exposed the insides. It scared me. One of them just stopped working altogether. I'm completely disappointed with this product.	0
I didn't like some of the plot twist, of a former leader of the Autobots but other than that it was pretty good.	1
I picked up the Kindle version of this book when Amazon made it free for a limited time, and I'm so glad they did (it worked out for Amazon too, because I purchased the other two books as soon as I finished this one). I had kind of fallen out of reading for pleasure and just bought the Kindle. This was my second book I read on it and I loved it so much that I've been reading like crazy ever since. Lawhead totally pulls you into the world he creates. The characters, environment, battles, and problems are all well developed and you end up totally engrossed. I'm glad it was a trilogy and not over after only this one book.A great read for any fantasy fan.	1
These diapers were good. They're nice and thin. But compared with luvs with ultra leakguards, I like the price of the luvs better. Performance between the two is about the same for me. These leaked from time-to-time for me but I haven't yet found any that don't.	1
This warmer keeps my coffee warm, but not as warm as I would like. The unit slides away from you as you push at the on-off switch. This annoyance was overcome with some automobile trim mounting tape. 3M Company 1/2X5 Molding Tape 03609Na Automotive Tape A small square of this double-sided foam tape under each foot will hold it in one place on your desk or table. I bought the Mr. Coffee warmer to replace a homemade warmer that was better at keeping the coffee hot, but finally succumbed to old age. That warmer was made by cutting off the top half of an old 4-cup brewer and using the bottom half (warming plate and switch) as a mug warmer.	1
My Family is busy and on the go a lot. this movies brought us all together for a couple hours. this movie is awsome. its a nice break from the ordinary of everyday life.	1
I bought it for 2 1/2 old, and she hates it, she is soooo scared of it, she cannot even see it, maybe she will be ready in 10 years	0
We have tried different diapers, but Pampers seem to be the best. They are soft, keep our baby dry and happy, and the velcro tabs are the best! I highly recommend them.	1
I loved it!!! If you loved The Secret (and Julie Garwoods other medieval stories) you will love this one just as much-- or more. You can't help but read it all at once. It's too good to put down and totally worth feeling sleepy over the next morning because you couldn't. I can't wait to see who's story we get next....	1
there must be someone who knows the answer to this: the baby as per wikipedia, says the baby was due 06/28/66 - My Question is: what day did the baby actually get delivered - ppl have told me yrs. ago it was 06/26/66 - any help would be appreciated!!!	1
I was disappointed in this item the color was faded along all four corners and it did not seem well crafted. I bought this item as a gift but I did not give it away. Now I am stuck with it.	0
"This is my second Sansa e series mp3 player. The first was a Rhapsody edition and lasted about 4 months. I blamed the short life on the R series and since I liked the way it looked and worked thought I would try it again with the e280. I loaded up my 8 gig with about 7 gig of music and now all I see is Sandisk - a brief flash of ""reading"" and then back to the Sandisk logo screen. It will do that for hours and hours on end. My computer doesn't even recognize it anymore. When I first plugged it in this evening the screen did come up to play music, but when I tried to, it said that the player was empty. I haven't tried contacting SanDisk. I think I will just cut my losses and write them off. The only Sansa product I've ever loved was the discontinued M series players -they're few and far between and highly sought after."	0
I purchased this book because I was writing a novel about the Native Americans who lived in the Finger Lake region f New York State. The book was helpful as far as gaining some insights into the life styles of these people. I really was not reading this book for its entertainment value.	1
I don't care about all the hype, I dig this record a lot. I play it, then I play it again. it's almost always in my head. I wish I had four more of her records. the performance is very loose and the production is really tight. rollicking, rowdy, catchy as hell. she's got a great spark.	1
This is one of the best video concerts ever. The sound, visuals and performances are top notch. It is a real joy. I have owned it a week and watched it 3 times already. Every performance is good. There are no dead spots during this concert and you get quite a number of them. A keeper. Memorable.	1
I love books that make me laugh, and a friend told me about this book. I paid full price, and I feel somewhat had. Ms. Jensen has a gift for humor, but the plotting involved in this book is horrible. Good humor has to have some element of believability in it, and this book has none whatsoever. With a believable story line, Ms. Jensen could be among the top humor writers out there.	0
i think the love brids are hyping this movie up, this is a review from someone that doesnt by into the love movie Douche thing: Not adams best, very repeatative movie. I dont think he will ever make another Happy gilmore, or Billy madison movie.	0
"Garbage continues in the tradition of their debut on Version 2.0. They never really break new ground, but at the same time, really don't need to. Their brilliant formula of avant-pop rock with dancefloor beats works all the way without sounding recycled or stale. Shirley's voice polishes the assault of instantaneously addictive riffs, both even sharper than they were on their self-titled debut. After bingeing in the dark, Garbage contrasts with flickers of light on Version 2.0, without losing their intensity or our attention. A fantastic follow-up to a wonderful debut. Best Tracks: ""Push It,"" ""The Trick Is To Keep Breathing,"" ""Temptation Waits,"" ""Special"" Rating: 8/10"	1

I bought this movie because I heard and read good things about it. Maybe these reviews were all written in the 60s who knows. Personally, this movie is overrated and the ending is just awful. I gave 2 stars for the simple reason that Mia Farrow is stunning.	0
"""Of Mice and Men"" is a beautifully crafted short novel concerning the relationship between two migrant workers from the 1930s. The first character, Lennie, has quite severe learning difficulties and relies heavily on his friend George. Lennie is very strong and this in itself gets him into all sorts of problems. George has to come to Lennie's aid on a regular basis as a result of him getting into trouble through misinterpretations of his actions and a naviety of his own strength.Genuinely moving, the reader cannot fail to build up a great empathy with the lead characters; less so with the other figures that appear in the book- despite each one having their own set of problems.Steinbeck does a tremendous job of conveying his story to the reader, and it would be a person with a heart made of stone that would not be moved by the story's conclusion.An excellent read for older children and adults of all ages. Highly recommended."	1
I was eager to find a DVD that should show me how to sew! But I was dissappointed when I received my DVD. It was probably recorded way back in the 80s. I had really problems following the steps the Lady showed. I found it rather boring to watch, and it is still standing on my shelf, and I'm not sure, if I will ever watch it again. I would rather recommand a sewing class to someone, who wants to learn how to sew, than paying almost 50 $ like I did for this old and boring video. It's not worth the money!	0

When I first listened to the CD I think it was okay, though I liked some of the songs instantly (like Invisible and Measure of a Man). However, the more I listen to it, the more I like it.The choice of songs are not good enough though..... they don't really show his ability ... but I still give the CD a 5 stars... because Clay's voice is just sooooooooooooooo amazing....... I love listening to his voice.... Clay is a truly great singer!!Just hope he will pick better songs for his next album.	1
I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun.	0
This is a pleasant, rather hokey coming-of-age tale that seems addressed to kids of 11 or 12, not to grownups. I don't understand why this isn't being marketed as a children's book, as it really has little to hold an adult reader's interest. The plot is very familiar and sentimental, and the writing is clear, uncluttered, and plain but not interesting in its own right. Buy it for your school-age son, but not for your father.	0
Rushed to press, not all of the Java2 API is included in this volume. I loved Java 1.1 and Beyond, but I wasted my money on this one...	0
It works but the next morning it has lost some shape and isn't as comfortable as it could be. For the price and the function is okay, the twin size made it right for our allowable space - but if you will need a longer term solution it is probably better to invest in a more expensive air bed.	0
"Plain and simple - Shakespeare sold out.*R&J* is simply sensationalist trash. It contains a good portion of Shakespeares worst verse and insipid characterizations. It's unchallenging, crude, and simply melodrama for the most part. It's the Shakespearean equivalent of ""Party of Five"" and the Spice Girls.The only saving grace of this ""play"" (why not call it a ""B-play?"") is the beautiful soliloquy by Mercutio about Queen Mab.The rest is absolute garbage.Read a real play. ""Hamlet,"" although dreadfully overplayed, is a fine work. So is ""Caesar.""And forget Shakespeare. There are other fine Elizabethan writers who have been forced to exist in the ""Bard's"" shadow. Had Marlowe lived, we wouldn't have even known about Shakespeare. And Donne finally been recognized for the genius that he is."	0
"This is a marvelous, detailed fantasy.All day, Ma and Pa Brindle make an enormous ""Sweet Dream Pie"". The pie is clearly magical - every move the Brindles make to bake this pie is echoed on the street. When they roll out the dough, everybody falls off their bed onto the floor. When the oven is on, the street is hot. When they blow on the pie to cool it off, a breeze picks up in the neighborhood.All the neighbors (except the little allergic girl) are invited to have a single slice of pie - but they eat too much, all of them, and promptly fall asleep, causing wild dreams to go up and down the neighborhood in a totally non-frightening way. The dreams are eventually swept away, and everybody gets a good night's sleep.The story and the illustrations are wonderfully detailed, as I said. The only thing that ever prevents me from reading this book is that it's a long one - sometimes, you really don't have time for it and have to use a shorter book instead."	1
It's nice to read a book like this. There is a very light tone through the book. And it's a short book, incidentally. You will finish it in about 2 sessions.I was happy to see that I'm not the only person annoyed at the way graphs are shown, with the bottom cut off to dramatize changes. This is only one example out of several. You woul be able to figure out some of these yourself, but not all of them. One was a bit deep and I had to read it a second time to understand what the falsity was.I recommend this book because it imparts valuable information in a readable fashion. Statistics are everywhere, and you absolutely must know how to separate the chaff.	1
What a colossal disappointment this turned out to be! The Justice League figures are the best superhero figures to come out since the Super Powers figures of the 1980s. They're colorful, durable, playable, and collectible. The Javlin 7 ship is also a nice piece for the Justice League collection. Imagine my disappointment over the Watchtower. While cool to look at, this toy is for display purposes only! As others have noted, it's shaky and falls apart with the slightest touch. What were the designers thinking when they created such flimsy legs for this heavy toy to be supported on? Also, the doors fly open quite easily. This toy will sit on my shelf with all the figures displayed on it. If you have small children avoid this at all cost and save your $35.	0
This seems like awfully shoddy science fiction to me. The old complaint about thin characterization isn't even the worst of it, nor are the crazy anachronisms [rampant cigar smoking, newspapers and casual misogyny]. But so much of this plot develops in the form of uninteresting local political maneuvers between slightly AynRandized heroes and buffooning villians, with no sense of place or grandeur whatsoever.The timeline of the novel is suddenly too breif after introducing the vast concept of a 40,000 year swing through history, and neither the future society Asimov has envisioned nor the apparant brilliance of the plan at the heart of this series are ever portrayed convincingly. Whatever powerful effect this book may have had in its day, it is bereft of it now.	0
Faith Wish is a great book that mature teenaged girls can relate to. AnneMarie, a beautiful, 17-year-old underachiever, has been put on an academic contract and will not graduate with her high-school class - to her dismay. When she attends a tabernacle meeting led by Brother Jackson, a charismatic, handsome self-proclaimed minister, she becomes a true Christian. After discovering she is pregnant with Brother Jackson's child, she turns to him for help, and he takes her to a spiritual redemption camp to find guidance. There, she sheds her old skin and past sins, including sex, drugs, and smoking. Unfortunately, all does not end well, as she struggles to find answers to her dilemna.	1
I have these in the maroonish-reddish color and they are so sexy!!!!! They are very high but comfy, not TOO shiny, and have the perfect cut for the office or out on the town!!! These will most def be pushed to the front of my shoe collection and I own over 150 pairs!!!	1
Prompt shipment and book is as ordered. Good customer service, would order from this source again.	1
Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it. Like i said, not much to say....i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 3.99 back!!!!	0
I am really disappointed with the quality of this 2 CD set. Plus, I wasn't able to find a track list anywhere, and I was missing a LOT of songs I was looking forward to having.	0
Lynn Austin beautifully combined the historical facts of Hezekiah's reign with her imagination of how one event may have led to the other. I was constantly looking at my Bible to be sure the scripture references were correct; they were!	1
It actually lasted a whole month until it decided to deflate and go flat. I guess I am just hard on blowup beds.I was using it every day as a regular bed, perhaps it would be better if used for visitors only.	0
This was my first Michener novel and I found it to be extremely entertaining. I too was disappinted that almost everyone dies off, but this isn't supposed to be a warm & fuzzy book, it's about a difficult journey made more difficult by the person in charge.Michener originally wanted to include this story in ALASKA, but that novel was already quite long. This is a perfect lead-in for Alaska and a great Michener book for the beginner or someone looking for something a bit shorter while between Michener classics.	1
This book has its pearls here and there but it is definitely NOT worth the price. I wouldn't pay $25 for it.The examples given are really worthless because all they basically do is drag and drop components and controls (almost anybody can figure that out). I would like to see more code, especially in the Database section. I mean the book is OK if you only paid $20 to $30. (Are they really selling the 60-day trial version of VS.NET?)	0
"The overall idea of the body suit was good however the fit not so much. I am about average hieght 5 6"" and weigh 130 but it seemed like it was made for a person smaller in stature. My guy was pleased with my appearance but the odd fit didn't make me feel as sexy as I wud have liked."	0
Works fine with little to no configuration or setup. On a tivo it works right out of the box.	1
This movie is great! The story is interesting, and I love the superb acting and special effects. This flick was truly watchable and enjoyable. It will have you glued to your screen! If you love scary movies, don't pass up this one!	1
First off, those stating how great this GBA game is obviously haven't played it or they find happiness in torture; this GBA version of Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring is one of the absolute worst games I've ever played and is a prime example of a licensed video game gone awry. You play as Frodo and you go through just about all the areas described in the original book while interacting with villagers and performing favors to get special items while also taking place in turn based battles with enemies. While this sounds good on paper (and like some old 16-bit RPG's that will remain nameless) there are so many glitches, bugs, and control issues (not to mention the battles take such an excruciating long time your head will spin in agony) that the overall feel of the game seems unfinished. All in all, this game will disappoint even the most hardcore fans of the Lord of the Rings series and they, along with any self respecting GBA owner, should avoid this at all costs.	0
"i started out taping garbage songs off the radio, till i figured out i could get them all on a cd. so i bought it & i still play it non stop. wherever i am in the house, its playing. i actually bought this before their first album, but i havent been disappointed in any of their music. this is an album you can let play through, without ever wanting to skip. my favs are ""when i grow up"" and ""temptation waits"", but they kinda rotate depending on my mood. this cd has a song for every mood, so go buy it now, you won't be disappointed."	1
"Hatebreed's just another pesky ""hardcore"" band destroying the scene. A bunch of...guys yelling about beliefs that aren't even their own? Sounds kind of like Slipknot. That's not the hardcore mentality, ...Hatebreed is the assumed forerunner of Victory Records, keeping good bands like Grade, Shelter, and Snapcase from playing main stage. Instead, they have to open up for a cross between nu-metal and rock and roll."	0
The reason is that it sounds great is because the album is kinda odd-yet very accessible-the vocals are so unique,The instrumentation is great, the performance is right on the money. The melodies and interplay amongst the various instruments has always held my attention. Oui sounds like the next step of a fine tuned, experimental, rock band. I'm always listening to and buying new music. I have generally liked most Sterolab songs so when I heard that Archer Prewitt had joined I figured I'd take a shot.The occasional electronic textures are cool, not in-the-way. I have been listening to this CD a lot lately. All in all this is a very good album. If you like other bands in this genre like Spoon, Smoke Ring Days, and Death Cab for Cutie, you will most likely like this. The Sea and Cake are the jazziest of the bunch.	1
This book is amazing. Its year-by-year descriptions are historical and often suspensful. I remember the first time I read this book, before I knew the outcome of many of the years' awards; each year was a new drama with Mr. Wiley and company setting up the atmosphere of the race. Now, fifteen years later, I own the latest edition of Inside Oscar. It is a constant source of amusement and information. The writing is skillful and clever, and the categorical listing at the back is an invaluable reference. Every year during Oscar season, I will pick up an article by some journalist whose grasp of Oscar history is minimal, and I wonder why they don't just look up who REALLY won in Inside Oscar. I know Mr. Wiley is no longer with us, but I hope Mr. Bona and company continue the great work for future editions. I know I'd love to be a contributor to this tremendous work.	1
Good basic book on modding. The pictures are of good enough quality to make the verbage much clearer. More details on opperating systems with the Xbox would have been helpfull. One still needs the internet and a good knowledge of where to go in order to find the rest of the puzzle.	0
to those who are praising this movie. It is fun, it is profound, it is whimsical, it is confrontational--everything that Hollywood movies are not. It is the kind of movie that demands repeated viewings. A MUST BUY!	1
Loving the book. Was in good condition and arrived in a timely manner! I can not wait to funish the book. Great price too. Thank you!	1
"Boards of Canada's full-length album was one I enjoyed immensely. This Peel Session is more an extension of that than anything. I liked the minor additions to Aquarius, and the Olson revamp is quite soothing, yet short. Happy Cycling is a track I had already on the album, but a great addition, no less. Perhaps the excellence of this release could have been helped by the addition of ""XYZ"", which was also recorded for that session. If you are looking to be blown away, look elsewhere; if you are looking for a couple new (yet familiar) tracks, this is the one for you. A definite ""A+"" for content, but a ""C"" for effort."	1
Awaiting the new Dan Brown novel, left me in search of similar fare. Thank you Steve Berry. Sure, there are some flaws in his historical facts and characterizations, but it is still an intelligent read. There is also plenty of action for those readers who enjoy a fast-paced novel.	1
"Don't be too critical of this flick. I've recently discovered Randal Malone to be quite entertaining, if not over the top at times, and consistent with making the rounds in B Horror; and he was creepy in this one. Yes, dimbulb college morons get killed off in this (like about five thousand other slasher flicks) and some can act and some are just eye candy like in Hell Night, Halloween, Friday the 13th and a Nightmare on Elm Street. This one leans more toward Prom Night (1980) or Deadly Lessons, though, with its level of gore and characterizations. It IS shot on video (a high def camera, I believe, if the crisp image is any indication) but as any horrorhound knows this isn't necessarily a bad thing (The Ripper from 1985 remains the low bar here). There is no new ground here (sorry Saw fans) and victims die because they're stupid. This is a fair little film and I keep hearing Randal Malone ask, ""Why are you here?"" in that distant, myopic voice that reminds me of Vinent Price."	1
I bought this book thinking that I would learn something or at least be given food for thought. What I got is a bad travelogue full of inane information about restaurants where the author ate, people he met, what he wore. There is nothing there for a serious or even amateur scholar. Just junk.	0
One of my favorite of Gord's albums because he's singing his heart even more than usual.Nothing commercial going on here; no pop tunes, no overt attempts at a single. Instead, the best collection of lyrics Gord ever put on a single album. Each song evokes a particular mood; just the right memories matched lyrically to just the right music.More than any other GL album, this one makes me feel like I know him.	1
Double dip express continues and continues and continues......Thankfully we have Amazon reviews to keep a few buyers from losing out, much like the LOTR Blurays.Still as long as there are consumers to buy these initial skimmed down releases and the studio can make a profit the farce will carry on.	0
This book is filled with recipes using brand-name adulterated products that contain large amounts of additives, preservatives, artificial flavors, colors, trans-fats, bland flavors and also cost a lot more then scratch foods.If you believe boiling potatoes, using fresh vegetables or measuring flour unthinkable, by all means this book is right up your alley....	0
As good as expected!! The only con is that it is supposed to fit babies from 17 to 25 pounds but my baby is only 18 pounds and it's already snug. Need to change to next size, other than that very good.	1
I have a 2 Year old boy and ever since he was born I use Pampers because they where the best product that work. I started with Pamper swaddlers, baby dry, cruisers and night time pampers. For the 36 months of using this product I had a couple of licks as usual but recently Pampers Baby Dry are not the same. THE DIAPER QUALITY HAS CHANGED; they are thinner and feel just like any generic brand diaper and they don't hold up to 12 hours as they claim. After using many diaper brands I chose Pampers because I had less licks but now it doesn't matter. I'm very disappointed because I spend a lot of money on diapers that are not up to the price. My Son's Baby Dry Diapers is just as good as generic diapers now. After 36 months o buying the same diaper I noticed the difference on the quality change; thank you Pampers Inc for making a despicable quality Diaper for a higher price.	0
While many families don't get along for one reason or another... Sometimes it takes a miracle to make people look at their own lives a bit closer... in this film.. mainly a comedy with some twist... you might relate to dealing with a whole family coming together for a mothers funeral.You may check out the trailer here as long as Youtube has it available[...]	1
We bought this for our 17 month old son. I put a Little Tikes Snug N Secure Swing in place of one of the regular swings. Every night my son runs straight for his swing. He is still too smaill for the climber, but I think he will enjoy this for many years to come.Assembly was a breeze, it took my husband about 20 minutes. the toughest part was figuring out the rope ladder.I highly recommend this toy!	1
Good bed. Definitely big enough for a good size dog. I have a collie. Zipper with removable cedar bags make it good for easy cleaning. Cedar helps with keeping away fleas and reducing dog smell. Very soft and my dog loves it.	1

The cord is long enough.It keep the water warm enough but not hot.If they redesign the design to an modern style it would be better.	1
It is fantastic for me, as for any huge Universal Horror fan, to find the wonderful music of Frank Skinner available on CD. Since I was a child watching these movies, I've always thought that Skinner's strings added enormously to the thrill factor in the Holmes series,'The Wolfman', 'Son of Frankenstein', etc. The instantly recognizable Universal Studio opening theme always made me run to see what was on. A true must-have addition for the classic horror collector!	1
This is movie making like, well, like they don't make any more. Great acting, great chemistry, totally fun. Throw away the modern movies geared to 12 year olds and buy this for the sheer pleasure of watching two of the most wonderful performers ever to grace our movie screens.Frank Scoblete: author of Golden Touch Dice Control Revolution!	1
If you work as a professional color laboratory tech or studio photographer, this book has definitive information about the characteristics of the multitude of available filters. The information is simply available no where else in this easy-to-reference format. Be cautioned that this book is not targeted at casual amateur photogs or those learning lab techniques.	1
I picked this up a few days ago and have briskly read through the entire novel since then. This is undoubtedly an epic masterpiece. It is one of the best science fiction books I have read to date. The main strength of the novel is a strong story with an excellent setting. The world is one of ancient religions, literal god-like beings, and advanced technology hiding under the mask of supernatural power. I will not spoil the story but will only say that it is told on an epic Lord of the Rings type scale. The allusions to Eastern philosophy and religion is pretty awesome too. For a sci-fi novel the characters were pretty good. They weren't great like in a Dostoevsky novel, but they weren't completely one-dimensional as is the case in too many sci fi novels. In all, it was masterful. If I ever become a sci fi author, Roger Zalazny would be one of my primary role models.	1
I have extremely sensitive skin.Regular soaps cause me to break out in a rash.I love this product it has no harsh chemicals and is Fragrance Free.It leaves my skin feeling silky smooth not dry and irritated.I even use it on my face and I noticed a big difference in the look and feel of my skin.If you have problem skin or sensitive painful skin I suggest you try this product I'm happy I did.	1
Not very interesting or informative. Better to buy a year's subscription to INC Magazine or Harvard's Entrepreneur Book.There is very little new information provided here. In fact some, of the information is leads the reader astray from 1999-2000 issues (LLC's, tax implications, true cashflow analysis)	0
"My daughter and her friend gave this film a big thumbs down:""We hated it. We were bored out my minds, and couldn't understand the story line at all. The acting was moderate. The only good thing about this movie was that it made us super hungry, since it was 3 hours long!..... At least smear a little spot of dirt on ""angel's"" face by the end.""""So basically, don't watch it.""""Sorry, people. We are very frustrated right now."""	0
Jacket is good to just protect your portfolio, but a handle and/or strap would be helpful to carry your portfolio.	0
The old saying hollywood never lost money underestimating the intelligence of the american people really hits you in the groin with this head shaker of a release.While the orignal classic rollerball hasn't even gotten an anamorphic dvd release, let alone a blu-ray!	0
I stumbled over this movie on a movie channel in a hotel in Bali, at about 3 o'clock in the morning, and I watched the whole thing.Crazy kung-fu story, over the top acting and more Matrix-like action sequences than you can shake a big stick at. The plot may be hard to follow, but if you want plot, watch Meryl Streep. This movie is about kicking ass, and believe me, everyones ass gets kicked. Different fighting styles satisfy the amateur kung-fu-ist, and the over the top wire movements make this seem more like a live action manga.If only the ladies in this film had agreed to nudity, it would get five stars. Oh, well....Seriously, one of the best in the genre.	1
Let's start out with the film. I would say that this Transformers film rivals the first one in quality. It's really that good. I would give it a solid four out of five. This was the first film that I had seen in IMAX 3-D after returning to the states from being stationed overseas. I was completely blown away with the 3-D effects and sound. However, I feel as if I have been duped by Paramount in that when I opened my blu-ray combo pack there was a 5 or 10 dollar off coupon for the Transformers: Dark of the Moon 3-D, Blu-ray/DVD+ Digital Copy! I know that the studio is trying to squeeze every dollar they can out of us, but come on! They probably had the 3-D version ready but wanted to milk us some more. I would not recommend buying this version and waiting on the newer one scheduled to release soon.So to summarize:Film- 4Shady Blu-ray release business practices- 1 (negative if I could)	0
This movie was really great, I wasn't expecting much, but this movie has more blood than any horror movie I've seen so far. Good story, very scary at times, and I don't scare easily, enjoyed this movie very much.	1
I have to say that I really really enjoyed this book. As soon as I was finished I drove over to my parents house to give it to them to read!There are some many mysteries surrounding the sightings of Mary, the mother of Jesus and putting them into this book with its conspiracy plot was magic. Although it puts some aspects of the Catholic Church in a bad light (and I'm Catholic), it is a work of fiction to be enjoyed on that level! I hope to read any other books by Steve Berry as I'm sure that they will be as wonderful as this was!	1

The kindle version has a few pages out of order, which is incredibly frustrating. Luckily I have the print version and could figure out what was going on. I informed Amazon about it but don't buy the digital version until it's fixed.	0
This album is not good. It's not the voice I heard on American Idol, the voice on this CD is not even good enough for Broadway. The power exhibited on American Idol is lost in this CD, I'm sorry folks, call it what you want but this CD isn't Clay Aiken. The attempt to turn him into a Pop King has taken away that beautiful voice. BRING IT BACK and forget about pop. Billboard may have said it is Pop Album of the Year but they forgot to say they took the voice away to make it pop.	0
What can I say that hasn't been said already? This is a classic....My 4 yr old granddaughter saw it for the first time and fell in love with Snoopy.	1
Previous reviews state false advertising because of the 360 degree movement, and the fact that you cant move into and out of the background. That is a truly ignorant comment because if you would notice that on a flat 2d plane there are 360 degrees. moving in all dimensions would actually be about 129600 degrees (360degrees * 360degrees). Also, while there may not be as many moves as other games, and the combo system is limited, you have to realize the strategy involved in the fighting system. You have to take advantage of other characters' flaws and time your projectiles. You have to lead characters with your projectiles and manage your psi. Limited moves are made up for with the strategic elements. However, some characters are overly cheap (Setsuna) which somewhat detract from the experience. All in all, this is a great game if you take the time to learn more about it.	1
Bought this after the Digital Copy expiration date had elapsed. Nothing on the Amazon site indicates the expiration date. The package has this warning on both the outside and inside. Amazon offered a full refund. That's a stand up company in my opinion.	0
1st. The Product Came On Time.2nd.I Saw A Portion Of This Film Over At A Freind Of Mines House.I Asked Him To Play It Over Again (Restart It).The Other People That Were Watching Didn't Seem That Enthused At The Idea Starting It Over From The Begining, So They Told Me About It Instead & That Was That As Far As Getting The Flick Restarted.3rd. Upon Getting It In My House, I Sat Down & Was Instanly Entertained. I Saw The Whole Movie Finally...	1
Despite being a PC133 slot, this chip didn't work with my computer... when I put it in, the computer wouldn't boot, when removed, it booted fine... Other RAM works fine... I've used many Kingston products and this is the first time I had any problems...	0
I decided to read this after seeing all the glowing reviews here. HA-don't believe that hype. I am a Stephen King/Dean Koontz fan and thought this book was AWFUL. None of the characters are fleshed out-you don't feel anything for them. They are cold and unrealistic. The plot is predictable and ridiculous. Skip this one.....	0
Doran is the worst Emma ever. She's completely cold and looks like a preying mantis. This was distracting because I kept expecting her to rip off Mr. Knightley's head and eat it. There is no chemistry at all between Emma and Mr. Knightley in this film. This version was very close to the book, and many of the other actors are quite good, so it's a shame about Doran. Watch A&E's Emma instead, with Kate Beckinsale. This version is not be as true to the book, but Kate does a much better job of portraying Emma's complexities than does Doran or Gwyneth.	0
I paid $2 for this at Gamestop. It is worth about $-30, (yes, that is NEGATIVE $30), because I wasted three hours of my life. Most of that three hours was spent working as a JANITOR, where nothing fun is happening.Most of the game play is spent walking around in circles in empty areas looking for the correct way out. Very boring. Enemies are not fun to fight. My favorite was the huge level with invisible enemies. How fun is it to spend hours going over the same layout again and again while looking for INVISIBLE creatures.This could be the worst game I ever played.Yes, I was stuck forever at the eco-dome, because there the door out wouldn't open. I think that might have been the bug referred to earlier.Do not buy this game.	0
Personally I would NOT buy the trilogy because spiderman 3 was horrible, 1 & 2 where great though. 3 not so good!	0
Porcupine Tree is amazing! Essential for anyone who likes rock and roll.Anesthetize (DVD + Blu-ray)	1
CSI is just one fine TV series, though it can go from engrossing the viewer to grossing the viewer out with some of its all-too-ugly scenarios. Yeah, but it's realism, they say.Another 'but' and a big one: just about all the viewers l know - friends, neighbors, co-workers - complain about the same thing: in the show, why is Marg Helgenberger all too often referred to as 'beautiful' or 'gorgeous' or 'lovely' when she is simply an ordinary-looking, run-of-the-mill actress with tight, low-cut clothing? Really! She hardly stands up to any lovely woman, so the question is: is she married to the producer or the Studio Head to get such unwarranted acclaim?	1
"Tom Brokaw knows better than his ""admiring"" comments about U.S veterans. he is giving too much credit to American WWII veterans. Other than raising his ""good old american image"", I see no point in praising a nation that only profitted from WWII. Brokaw should spend his time on other journalistic adventures, and stop being a hedonist."	0
I bought these to use on a Samsung WEP200 blu-tooth head set. The one I am using, works fine and fits the Samsung properly. It is much more comfortable than the thingy that came on the Samsung. I must say, it is a shame to buy something that comes in a pack of six and you can only utilize one or two out of six. It should be sold in multiple packs, all of the same size.	1
"My Trans-metropolitan counterpart beneath me definitely describes this cd well. I love the reference to Wallpaper, perhaps the greatest magazines ever (with Surface, Homme, and maybe Metropolitan Home) not far behind.But I digress... This cd, as with all of the releases in this series is excellent. Tosca's contribution is, of course, amazing. However, the entire width and breadth of this release is one that permanenty stays in the player.However, I would strongly urge you to seek out ""Volume Five"" of this series. It offers your senses two cd's of the finest Compost has to offer. I found it a local vendor, new, for an amazing price (under $15).A very, very worthwhile release...will not disappoint you."	1

hmmm...just think....Noel, a brilliant man, maKING A CD that is just crap. What happened!!!!! I can't believe it....over played solos....awful lryics!!!!! Just when you think they could make another brilliant album, they make a crappy album.

All the features are nice, TV Guide worked (note that browsing and setting recording preferences is very SLOW), BUT when the TV Guide is downloading (all the time) or you are recording / playing from the hard drive you constantly hear a grinding sound from the hard drive.

Invisible is a great song, the best song on the cd. The rest is just blah and sounds the same. Clay has a very nice voice, but this cd is just plain boring. Broadway Clay could never have become a recording artist without the AI hype. He's certainly no Josh Groban, that's for sure.	0
My son loves these kinds of movies. He says it is awesome and said, If you love gore you will love these movies.	1
"These are a real hit with everyone, from kiddie parties to Bar-B-Q's! Lots of fun,and different than most novelty items. Put them in your glove compartment in case you get stranded, next to your bed in case the power goes out, toss them in the pool, the tub, the punchbowl,the fun ideas with these things are endless. Incidentally, these work just the same as all the other ""Waterless"" drink coolers that we've had since long before the ""lighted"" ones arrived on the scene. Why-ever would you ""throw them out"" just because the light was done??"	1
"I got this as a gift for my 5yr old and he loves it. It's cute, but smaller than you'd think and definitely overpriced at $13.99 plus shipping. In a store, I wouldn't pay more than half of that price for this toy. Be prepared: the top jaw slams down on your finger, and while my son doesn't cry (it doesn't really hurt so much as it surprises you), he does yell ""ouch"" ...And then continues playing with it. The tooth that makes the crocodile ""bite"" is random so you never know which one it'll be. The game goes quickly and can be fun for the entire family, which is nice when it's so hard to find games that not only appeal to the whole family, but can be played by families with age ranges from preschool children to older adults. It's a great way to squeeze a family game in on a busy weeknight. It works as a travel game too, since there are no loose pieces and it's a fairly small size."	1
"E' dai tempi del tour di ""empire"" che non vedevo i queensryche cos√¨ in gran forma, questo dvd per me √® il migliore di tutta la loro carriera, e la consacrazione di una band, dopo questo dvd si pu√≤ tranquillamente dire che i queenssryche sono entrati nella storia del grande rock come i Deep purple, led zeppelin e thin lizzy negli anni settanta.I queensryche sempre si sono distinti dagli altri gruppi del loro genere, Geoff Tate √® uno dei pi√π importanti vocalists di tutti i tempi.Questo dvd √® musica e teatro, la collaborazione pi√π stretta con Pamela Moore rende questo dvd imperdibile.Una sola nota negativa, purtroppo nella composizione della seconda parte si sente l'assenza di Chris De Garmo,Mike Stone √® un grande chitarrista, ma Chris De Garmo per me era fondamentale per la band, hanno perso la parte pi√π melodoca, che era a mio parere molto importante in questo gruppo!"	1
I loved this movie so much. Everything was perfect. It balanced the action and the drama perfectly and was a very mature film. It was realistic and not cartooney like the next four films in the series. The acting all round was excellent. Christian Bale was great as Batman. Also Morgan Freeman, Michael Cain, Cillian Murphy, Gary Oldman and everyone were great. But I was most surprised with Katie Holmes. She really held her own standing among these great male actors. Overall BATMAN BEGINS is the best of the five Batman films.The Series:1- BATMAN BEGINS2- BATMAN3- BATMAN RETURNS4- BATMAN FOREVER5- BATMAN & ROBIN	1
"It is amazing that all of the sections and the 50 little balls fit into such a small space! It is definitely as much fun as it looks! My niece's son climbed inside as soon as we set it up and said, ""FUN!"" He absolutely LOVES it! It is a very good value for the price!"	1
There are so many wonderful recipes in this book that I can't wait to try them all. It has been so much fun reading the book that I am really looking forward to getting all the ingredients and trying them. I plan to take the book over to Scotland when I visit this year to give the family some exciting new ideas. A GREAT BOOK!!	1
"After reading Into Thin Air, I have read everything I could get my hands on regarding the 96 Everest tragedy. I have turned into an ""Armchair Everest Junkie"". Lene's perspective on her survival was of particular interest to me because I am such a chicken when it comes to taking risks. This book was more about who Lene liked and who she thought little of. There was very little credible information that shed light on what she went through. I found it distasteful that she took shots at those whom she accompanied and collectively staked their lives on the bid for the Everest summit. True, Anatoli was a fine mountaineer and human being but he was the only other person she respected. That pretty much sums up the book!"	0
"If there ever was an album that says ""Roll Another Number"" it's this mellow, funky little gem. Whenever I listen to this I want to call up the bro's for a BBQ, chill out with some 40's rollin' fatties and talkin' about the ladies. OH YEAH!! If you like this music check out ""Jalamanta"" and Che- ""Sounds of Liberation"" if you can find'em. This is music for the people..Get it on!!"	1
THE SWORD IN THE STONE is just about the best fantasy that I have ever read. It is a story of the childhood of Wart, later known as King Arthur, and is filled with delightful adventures that fulfill childhood dreams-such as becoming a owl and being able to fly. Not only that,but this book is also filled with the wonder and the wisdom of T.H.White. To read it is an undescribable experience.I recommend it uncondoitionally to all lovers of fantasy	1
I was on the fence about a child birth class, so I bought this video. I watched the first lesson on her website and that was really helpful. I really liked it. Sheri is fun. She knows her stuff and you feel like you are in the class with them. It did drone on at some points (medical interventions/medications/cord blood banking). When you get to the second disc, she talks about medications, positions, and really important stuff, but after a few mins it gets to be too much. Watch this in small increments! It makes processing the information so much easier. You can always go back and watch important sections again :-))) I plan on buying the breastfeeding video!!	1
"I did not think I was going to like this film, because the language is coarse and you have to read the subtitles to understand the Scottish accents.But this film shows you what happens when emotions, not intellect, control your behavior. We are taken on an unbelievable roller-coaster ride, where anything that CAN go wrong DOES go wrong...or does it really?At one point in this movie, I had to hit the pause button, because I couldn't stop laughing. And at the end, I couldn't stop crying. ""I want my mommy"" has never touched me like it did here.This film is a masterpiece."	1
I originally saw this movie in 1966 while pregnant with my first child. Not a recommended thing to do. Scared me to death and made me realize what evil is out there. Still just as scary today.	1
Books don't come much better than this. Elizabeth George Speare does a great job of making history come alive, and Kit Tyler is a fascinating heroine- imperfect yet trying to keep her spirits alive in a strange, unpleasant, and foreign world. Young teenagers may not grasp the complexities of Kit Tyler and her newfound family, but anyone who has felt like they don't fit in will appreciate this great book.	1
Definitely too big for my 10 pound yorkie. I was able to tighten it around her neck by sewing it and now it works great. It takes a while for the dog to get used to but makes such a difference when walking her!	1
This is one of the better Adam Sandler movies I've seen. It is funny and heart-warming, without going over the top. I don't always like Drew, but she does a great job in this one. A really great movie!	1
The brush is stiff, I guess you get used to it. It has a long handle, compared to a hair bush? The handle is smooth and you cannot grip it when you are in the shower. It is anything but ergonomic. I guess you take a dry bath. Do not buy this brush unless you are needing to bristle off some very caked on dry skin or rust and can use a grinder to make the handle gripable. What a waste of good money.	0
very bad item stopped working after 3 days now i need to spend time getting this item to be shipped back dont waste your money on this item	0
"Alfie is another british band with an unexplainable amount of talent. Unexplainable because it seems most british groups are ingenious in their own way. Where did they get it from? Who knows? But i do know that us rebels over here in the beautiful u.s., took only a bit of that musical ingenuity when crossing the big pond back in the day. Okay, all gawking aside, i must admit that alfie's lead singer reminds me slightly of the lead singer of ""they might be giants"". That's a good thing if you like (or can tolerate) ""they might be giants"". Luckily i grew up listening to my sisters collection of music, and t.m.b.g. happened to be in the mix. So alfie, like you might expect, is ingenious (on tracks 2 & 3 inparticular) and a bit quirky (especially the vocals(all tracks)). But don't buy this album because you want good, strange music, buy it because it's good, mellow music with great instrumentation and a unique sound."	1
I purchased this product last week and discovered that it was garbage. The strips shape is terrible and it does not remove the hair. Complete waste.....:(	0
I guess I was looking for a better result than I got. It did do the job and the hot dogs were adequate, but the buns were a different story (too dry and stale).	0
I really liked the first one, and the second one was okay too. But Dark of the Moon was difficult to sit through for me. Endless dialogue with minimal action sequences, I found myself looking at the time far too often. They dropped Meghan Fox, who despite her controversial reputation, definitely added to the cast. The special effects are still amazing, but there just wasn't enough action. BORING!!! If they are going to continue with this franchise they had better turn it up a few notches.	0
This trip down memory lane did not work for me. What was funny when I was a child, now pretty much not at all. Fodder for Goodwill.	0
I can't recommend this fan simply because the output is so weak it doesn't actually get any thing done. Well if i had to say some thing nice about it that would be it has a nice LED light in there. So in conclusion don't waste your money on this product get a better reviewed one instead.	0
The book covers several generations, so with each generation you have to re-learn all the characters. It is difficult to keep track of who's who when every time you get to know the cast, 200 years suddenly pass and we're in the middle of a new crisis. I didn't read the whole series because of this -- it was obnoxious.	0
Alot of people have complained that this could not possibly be the entire first season of the show but it is.... Even if the show had such a short first season it was still a really good deal. It arrived right when it was supposed to and it's a pretty good aswell!	1
After spending the 30 minutes of my time putting together the hundreds of pieces and placing all the tiny stickers in the correct spots- it fell apart completely! Its a totally unusable toy. The cardboard background doesnt even fit in properly and my son has never touched it due to how unstable and flimsy it is. It is too tall to stand on its own and comes with something to adhere it to the wall! Dont waste your time and money on this horrible product!	0
Didn't realize what games I would be getting with Namco other than ms.pac man, I was hoping there would be mappy lol but game came as expected.	1
Ok, military soldiers have short hair cuts, but not Sorbo. The first air-boat scene, the air boat was so overloaded, it could barely move. The script was so poor, that I wanted to vomit. A soldier takes a look at a corpse from 2 feet and says that the head has been drilled into and the brains sucked out, making him better than Kay Scarpatta. Really!	0
"How did this collection of letters make it to print...when there are scores of personalities whose letters I'd love to read in a collection that haven't? These letters are very boring and he did not write to many notable people (a few to McCartney, Lennon and Olivier). Before you read about a theater critic, read what William Goldman said in his legendary book about Broadway THE SEASON, in the chapter titled ""The Approvers."" That tells you all about theater critics you need to know. THEN you can decide whether to read this one of Tynan's letters. I don't think this book would have made it to print if Tynan's wife hadn't been shoving it down publisher's and editor's throats. Dull, dull, dull, except for about five of the letters."	0
This book is perfectly delightful. I purchased this for my husband, and he has spent hours pouring over it. The pictures are wonderful and very high quality. He swears I bought it because so many pictures are of him in trouble at the golf course (not true!), but loads of laughs.	1
"A first rate beautifull compilation, with every selection a winner. One of my personal favorties. Great music and great soundinf too. Ella's ""Spring Can Really Hang You Up The Most"" was for me, a revelation. All artists best work."	1
Okay, this was the last album I purchased after listening to all 4 albums of Evergrey. I have to say this record has something to it, it has a completely different atmosphere. So many songs on this record are so powerful in meaning and in music, listening to them atleast 20 times is not enough at all. Having the preachers voices in the background in a couple of songs defenitely touches souls in some way or other.5 Thumps Up!!!	1
Too much time spent on secondary characters or too much time spent apart by the main characters made this very slow reading for me. I really liked Jake to begin with but I eventually came to not really care. The initial conflict was very strong, but then the author seemed to drift off and care more on Jake's in-law's relationship. The final conflict was resolved too easily for me to really buy into it.But it's not all bad. Ms. Wells writing voice is smooth and easy. I'd be interested to see what she comes up with in the future.	0
I had high hopes for this product after the Rabbit Habit's beads froze the first time I used it. I thought the way the beads were set in this product would be better and it was, BUT...the material is so stiff that the action of the bunny ears actually HURT my clit! None of the softness and thus realistic tongue like action of the Rabbit Habit. That's really the point, isn't it? It just poked me, along with the hard little nose, which also hurt. Cheap, but a waste of money.	0
"THE PICTORIAL KEY TO THE TAROT: BEING FRAGMENTS OF A SECRET TRADITION UNDER THE VEIL OF DIVINATIONLadies and Gentlemen,This is the MOST DIFFICULT to read book I have ever purchased in my life (and I purchase a LOT of books.) The references the author uses are ambiguous; trying to follow his train of thought and LEARN something is like trying to lift mercury with a fork. There are several GOOD books on the Tarot here on Amazon. Please believe me when I tell you: you'll do better picking ANY ONE of them over this book. In fact; contact me and you can have this copy I purchased FOR FREE ~ and spare yourself an expensive lesson.I hope I don't appear too harsh nor vindictive. I don't write ""Book Reviews"" ~ ever. I only write this one to Spare You."	0
"This is a stage play! It isn't the novel.This may be a wonderful thing for high school drama departments, but it wasn't what I wanted.It may be that I'm just an idiot and missed the clear statement that I was buying ""Men at Arms _*THE PLAY*_"". Nevertheless, a stage play is not what I thought I was paying for."	0
"My old wireless adapter from Netgear stopped working on Friday evening. I ordered this Tivo wireless adapter by 6:30pm EST and chose Saturday delivery (Amazon Prime. Shipping was $6.99). At 10:00am on Saturday morning the UPS truck dropped it off at my front door. I was back in business by 10:15am. I just plugged in the adapter into the USB slot in back of my Tivo unit. I went to ""Settings"" on the Tivo menu and restarted the unit. Everything worked fine, it started updating my program guide immediately. When you are replacing a network adapter you do not have to re-enter your network settings nor the computers WPA/WEP security code. The settings were saved on the Tivo unit when I switched the adapters. Also be informed that this adapter connects via a USB cord that is about 3 feet long. It allows you to place the adapter in different areas and positions for the best signal. (The strength of signal is obtained in the Tivo ""Settings"" menu under ""phone/network"")."	1
"An interesting book only if you enjoy learning how people in earlier history thought and lived. I manage to read two or three pages a day, but it is not a ""pleasure"" read. I would never buy it, but as a free read, it's fine."	0
OCP PLANS ON DESTROYING DETROIT TO BUILD DELTA CITY. BUT, WHEN A GANG OF ANGERED RESIDENTS DECIDE TO FIGHT OCP BACK, PROBLEMS IMMEDIATELY BEGIN. TO ADD TO THE PROBLEMS, ROBOCOP [PLAYED HERE BY ROBERT JOHN BURKE] JOINS THE PEOPLE IN THEIR QUEST FOR FREEDOM. NOT AS VIOLENT AS THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, AND IT'S ALSO NOT AS GOOD. THE BIGGEST MISTAKE THEY MADE WITH THIS MOVIE WAS TO REPLACE PETER WELLER AS ROBOCOP. ROBERT JOHN BURKE JUST SEEMS LOST AS ROBOCOP. THIS SERIES WAS SERIOUSLY STARTING TO RUN OUT OF STEAM TOWARD THIS POINT. WHY COULDN'T THEY JUST KEEP THIS ONE ON THE SHELF? ANYWAY, ANOTHER BIG MISTAKE THEY MADE WAS TO HAVE ANN, ROBO'S PARTNER FROM THE FIRST TWO MOVIES, GET KILLED. HAS A FEW GOOD ACTION SEQUENCES, BUT IT'S SERIOUSLY LACKING THE ENTERTAINMENT THAT CAME WITH THE FIRST TWO MOVIES. IF YOU STILL HAVEN'T SEEN THIS BUT YOU WANNA SEE IT, RENT THIS, BUT DON'T BUY THIS. FOLLOWED BY FOUR DIRECT-TO-VIDEO MOVIES.	0
"This NYC group has authentic early reggae/rocksteady sound. The music features great organ and tight rhythm section. The lyrics are just right for the mood of each song. Includes a brilliant rocksteady version of Johnny Cash's ""Long Black Veil"" -- best remake of this classic song I've heard. If you didn't know, you'ld swear it was the late 60s and you were catching Jamaican radio broadcasts."	1

At the Tabard Inn, thirty travelers from a diversity of classes and occupations are planning to make the annual pilgrimage to Becket's shrine at Canterbury. It is agreed that each traveler will tell four tales to help pass the time, and the host of the inn will reward the best storyteller with a free supper when they return. The Canterbury Tales is a sometimes bawdy, sometimes spiritual classic, skillfully translated into modern English and presented in an unabridged audiobook format. Read by Martin Jarvis and a full cast, The Canterbury Tales reveals the trials and travails of daily life in late fourteenth-century England through stories, conversations, jokes and arguments between travelers. Truly the most memorable way to experience this literary classic, The Canterbury Tales is especially recommended for public library collections. 17 CDs, 21 hours, tracks every 3 minutes for easy bookmarking.	1

Boring. What was I expecting? Something that would give me insight into my own abilities to heal self and others. This didn't do it. Especially since it wasn't in English.	0
